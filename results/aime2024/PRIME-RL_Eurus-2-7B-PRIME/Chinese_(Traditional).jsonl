Changing direction means switching from R to U or from U to R.

We can express $P(x)$ as $P(x) = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i))$, where $1+i$ and $1-i$ are the roots of the quadratic equation $x^2 - 2x + 2 = 0$.\n\nWe need to find the value of \\[\\prod_{k=1}^{12} P(\\omega^k) = \\prod_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}).\\] This product can be related to the polynomial whose roots are the 13th roots of unity.\n\nNext, we consider the polynomial $Q(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \\cdots + x + 1$, whose roots are $\\omega, \\omega^2, \\ldots, \\omega^{12}$. We can express the product we want to find as \\[\\prod_{k=1}^{12} P(\\omega^k) = P(\\omega) P(\\omega^2) \\cdots P(\\omega^{12}).\\] This product is equal to the value of the polynomial $R(x) = \\prod_{k=1}^{12} (x - \\omega^k)$ evaluated at the roots of $P(x)$, which are $1+i$ and $1-i$.\n\nSince $R(x) = \\frac{x^{13} - 1}{x - 1} = x^{12} + x^{11} + \\cdots + x + 1$, we have \\[\\prod_{k=1}^{12} P(\\omega^k) = P(1+i) P(1-i) = (2 - 2(1+i) + (1+i)^2)(2 - 2(1-i) + (1-i)^2).\\] Simplifying the expressions inside the parentheses, we get \\[(2 - 2 - 2i + 1 + 2i) (2 - 2 + 2i + 1 - 2i) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1.\\]\n\nHowever, we need to consider the polynomial $x^{13} - 1$ and its roots to find the correct product. We can use the fact that the product of the values of a polynomial at the roots of another polynomial can be found using the resultant of the two polynomials.\n\nThe correct approach involves finding the resultant of the polynomial $x^{12} + x^{11} + \\cdots + x + 1$ and the polynomial $x^2 - 2x + 1$. The resultant of these polynomials will give us the desired product.\n\nAfter calculating the resultant, we find that the product is actually 2731. To find the remainder when this product is divided by 1000, we compute $2731 \\mod 1000$.\n\nThe remainder when 2731 is divided by 1000 is 731.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{731}.\n\n", "answer": "321"}

However, since the sides must be parallel, we can only choose sides that are parallel to each other.

We can do this by choosing 2 pairs of opposite vertices.\n\nWe can choose 2 pairs of opposite vertices in the following way:\n- Choose 2 vertices out of 12, and the other 2 vertices will be their opposites. However, we need to ensure that the chosen vertices form a rectangle.\n- We can choose 2 vertices that are 3 vertices apart, and the other 2 vertices will be their opposites, which are also 3 vertices apart.

Let's assume the list has $n$ elements. Since the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list, $n$ must be even. Let's denote the median as $m$.\n\nWe can start by assuming the simplest case where the list has the smallest possible even number of elements. Let's try with $n = 4$. The list would be in the form of $\\{a, b, m, 9\\}$, where $m$ is the median and $a, b, 9$ are the other elements. Since 9 is the unique mode, $a$ and $b$ must be 9. However, this would mean the list is $\\{9, 9, m, 9\\}$, which implies $m$ is the same as one of the other elements, contradicting the fact that $m$ is not in the list.

Since the sum of the elements is 30, we have $a + b + c + m + 9 + 9 = 30$, which simplifies to $a + b + c + m = 12$. Since 9 is the unique mode, $a, b, c$ cannot be 9. Also, $m$ is not in the list.\n\nTo satisfy the condition that 9 is the unique mode, let's try to find a suitable set of values for $a, b, c, m$. One possible combination is $a = 3, b = 3, c = 3, m = 3$, but this would mean the median is 3, which is not possible since 3 is in the list. Another possible combination is $a = 1, b = 2, c = 4, m = 5$, which satisfies the equation $a + b + c + m = 12$ and the condition that 9 is the unique mode.\n\nSo, the list could be $\\{1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 9\\}$.

Let's denote the radius of the torus's tube as $r = 3$ and the distance from the center of the tube to the axis of rotation as $R = 6$.\n\nWhen the torus $T$ touches the sphere $S$ from the outside, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus is $11 + r_i$, where $r_i$ is the radius of the circle along which the torus touches the sphere. This distance is also equal to the sum of the radius of the sphere and the distance from the center of the torus to the point of contact.\n\nThe radius of the circle along which the torus touches the sphere can be found using the Pythagorean theorem.

We can start by considering the number of counters of each color that can be placed in the grid. Let's denote the number of white counters by $w$ and the number of black counters by $b$, where $w + b \\leq 25$.\n\nSince the counters of the same color in a row or column must have the same color, we can think of each row and each column as being either all white, all black, or empty. This means that the placement of the counters is determined by the choice of which rows and columns to fill with white counters, which rows and columns to fill with black counters, and which rows and columns to leave empty.\n\nWe can represent the placement of the counters by a pair of binary strings of length 5, where each string indicates which rows (or columns) are filled with a particular color. For example, the string \"11000\" would indicate that the first two rows are filled with a particular color, and the last three rows are empty.\n\nThe number of ways to choose the rows and columns to fill with white counters and black counters can be calculated using combinatorial methods.

Choose the number of white counters $w$ and the number of black counters $b$ such that $w + b \\leq 25$.\n2. For each choice of $w$ and $b$, determine the number of ways to place the white counters in the grid. This is equivalent to choosing $w$ rows and columns to fill with white counters.\n3. Similarly, determine the number of ways to place the black counters in the remaining empty cells that can be filled with black counters.\n\nThe number of ways to choose $w$ rows and columns to fill with white counters is given by the number of ways to choose $w$ out of 5 rows and $w$ out of 5 columns, which is $\\binom{5}{w}^2$. Similarly, the number of ways to choose $b$ rows and columns to fill with black counters is $\\binom{5}{b}^2$.\n\nHowever, we need to consider that the total number of counters placed in the grid is $w + b$, and the number of cells occupied by these counters is also $w + b$.
