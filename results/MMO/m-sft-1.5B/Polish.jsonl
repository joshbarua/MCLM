So, the problem is about two points being drawn by Dana on a plane, and Lolek then draws two half-lines from each of these points. The goal is to find the maximum number of regions, k, that Lolek can ensure there are, regardless of where the original two points are drawn by Dana. \n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the setup correctly. We have two points, say A and B, on a plane. These points are chosen by Dana, and their positions are such that no two lines through them are vertical (mainly vertical and horizontal) and no two are coinciding. Lolek then draws two half-lines from each point. Each half-line is either horizontal or vertical. So, from point A, he draws one horizontal and one vertical half-line. Similarly, from point B, he draws one horizontal and one vertical half-line. The question is, regardless of where A and B are (as long as they satisfy the given conditions), what's the maximum number of regions that can be formed by these four half-lines?\n\nHmm. So, regions formed by lines... I remember that the number of regions created by n lines in general position (no two parallel, no three concurrent) is given by the formula (n(n+1))/2 + 1. But in this case, we don't have all lines; we have four half-lines (two from each point). Also, the lines are of two types: horizontal and vertical, and from two points. So, maybe the formula isn't directly applicable here.\n\nWait, but maybe we can approach it by considering how each half-line divides the plane and how they interact with each other. Let's start by considering that each half-line divides the plane into two parts. When you add a half-line, it can potentially intersect existing lines, creating new regions. The maximum number of regions is achieved when each new line intersects all previous lines, thereby maximizing the number of new regions created.\n\nBut in this case, we have two points, each with two half-lines. So, in total, there are four half-lines. Let me think about how each half-line can intersect the others.\n\nFirst, consider the two half-lines from point A. Since they are horizontal and vertical, they are perpendicular to each other. Similarly, the two half-lines from point B are also perpendicular. So, from A, we have a horizontal line and a vertical line. From B, another horizontal and vertical. Depending on the positions of A and B, the intersections of these lines will vary.\n\nBut Lolek wants to arrange the half-lines in such a way that they maximize the number of regions. However, the problem states \"regardless of the position of points drawn by Dana.\" Wait, so Dana can choose any two points (not vertical or horizontal, and not coinciding). So, Lolek needs to choose the two half-lines from each point (horizontal and vertical) in a way that, no matter where the original points are, Lolek can still achieve the maximum number of regions.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"Dana is a positive integer n, and Bolek draws 2n points on the plane...\". Wait, maybe there was a typo in the problem statement? Let me check again.\n\nWait, the original problem says: \"Given a positive integer n, Bolek draws 2n points on the plane, where any two do not lie on the same vertical or horizontal line, and none are coinciding. Then, Lolek, for each of these 2n points, draws two half-lines: one from the point on the line perpendicular to the main axis, and one on the axis itself.\" So, actually, the problem structure is that for each of the 2n points, Lolek draws two half-lines: one perpendicular to the main axis (either vertical or horizontal) and one along the main axis. Wait, maybe \"main axis\" refers to one of the axes, maybe the horizontal one? Because the problem mentions \"perpendicular to the main axis, and on the axis itself.\" So, for each point, one half-line is perpendicular to the main axis (say, horizontal), and the other is along the main axis (horizontal). Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the main axis is either vertical or horizontal, and the half-lines are drawn perpendicular to that. Hmm, the problem is a bit ambiguous here.\n\nWait, let's parse the problem statement again carefully:\n\n\"Dana is a positive integer n, and Bolek draws 2n points on the plane, where any two do not lie on the same vertical or horizontal line, and none are coinciding. Then, Lolek, for each of these 2n points, draws two half-lines: one from the point on the line perpendicular to the main axis, and one on the axis itself.\"\n\nHmm. So, for each of the 2n points, Lolek draws two half-lines: one perpendicular to the main axis (which could be either vertical or horizontal) and one along the main axis. So, if the main axis is the horizontal axis, then the half-lines would be horizontal and vertical. Similarly, if the main axis is vertical, the half-lines would be vertical and horizontal. But the problem says \"perpendicular to the main axis, and on the axis itself.\" So, perhaps the main axis is one of the axes, and the half-lines are perpendicular to it and along it. Therefore, for each point, Lolek draws a horizontal and vertical half-line.\n\nBut then the problem states that Bolek draws 2n points, with the constraints that no two lie on the same vertical or horizontal line. So, each point is in general position with respect to the main axis and the other axis. Wait, but Lolek's half-lines are perpendicular to the main axis (i.e., horizontal) and along the main axis (i.e., vertical). So, regardless of the main axis chosen by Bolek, Lolek's half-lines are horizontal and vertical. But since the main axis is either vertical or horizontal, depending on Bolek's choice, then Lolek's half-lines would be either horizontal and vertical. But the problem is about the maximum number of regions Lolek can achieve, regardless of Bolek's arrangement (since Bolek can choose any 2n points, as long as they are in general position). So, Lolek needs to choose the orientations of his half-lines (horizontal and vertical) such that, no matter how Bolek arranges his points (as long as they are in general position), Lolek can still maximize the number of regions.\n\nWait, but if Bolek can choose the points in any orientation, then Lolek needs to choose the orientation (horizontal/vertical) of his half-lines such that the maximum number of regions is guaranteed. But the problem says \"regardless of the position of points drawn by Bolek,\" so Lolek has to choose the orientation such that even in the worst case (i.e., Bolek's points arranged in any way), Lolek's half-lines can still achieve the maximum number of regions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that Bolek can arrange his points in any way (as long as they are in general position), and Lolek needs to choose the orientation of his half-lines (horizontal/vertical) such that, for any such arrangement, the number of regions is at least k. So, the maximum k such that Lolek can always achieve k regions, regardless of Bolek's points.\n\nTherefore, the problem is to find the maximum k where, no matter how Bolek places his 2n points (in general position, since no two on the same vertical/horizontal), Lolek can choose a horizontal/vertical orientation (i.e., pick one axis as the main axis) such that the number of regions created by his half-lines is at least k.\n\nSo, given that, we need to find the maximum k such that, for any 2n points, there exists a horizontal/vertical orientation (i.e., choosing a main axis) such that the four half-lines (two horizontal, two vertical) divide the plane into at least k regions.\n\nHmm. Let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, if Bolek has placed his points in general position with respect to the main axis (horizontal or vertical). Then, Lolek draws a half-line perpendicular to the main axis (i.e., horizontal) from each point, and a half-line along the main axis (vertical) from each point. So, for each point, a horizontal and a vertical line. So, for 2n points, there are 2n horizontal lines and 2n vertical lines. But these lines are drawn from the points, so each line starts at a specific point and extends infinitely in one direction (half-line). Therefore, the arrangement is not a full grid, but rather a set of half-lines emanating from 2n points.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the half-lines are drawn from the point on the line perpendicular to the main axis, and on the axis itself.\" So, for each point, one half-line is perpendicular to the main axis (horizontal if main axis is vertical, vertical if main axis is horizontal), and the other is along the main axis (vertical or horizontal). So, for each point, two half-lines: one in the direction perpendicular to the main axis, and one along the main axis. So, for example, if Bolek chooses the main axis as the horizontal axis, then from each point, Lolek draws a vertical half-line (perpendicular to the horizontal axis) and a horizontal half-line (along the horizontal axis). Similarly, if Bolek chooses the main axis as vertical, then from each point, he draws a horizontal half-line (perpendicular to the vertical axis) and a vertical half-line (along the vertical axis).\n\nTherefore, regardless of the main axis chosen by Bolek, Lolek's half-lines are always horizontal and vertical. Wait, no. Wait, if the main axis is horizontal, then the half-lines are vertical (perpendicular) and horizontal. If the main axis is vertical, then the half-lines are horizontal and vertical. So, in either case, the half-lines are horizontal and vertical, one in each direction. Therefore, the orientation of the half-lines (horizontal/vertical) is independent of Bolek's main axis choice. Wait, but Bolek can choose the main axis, but Lolek is choosing the direction of the half-lines. Wait, the problem states \"the half-lines are drawn from the point on the line perpendicular to the main axis, and on the axis itself.\" So, for each point, the half-line is perpendicular to the main axis (i.e., if the main axis is horizontal, the half-line is vertical; if the main axis is vertical, the half-line is horizontal). So, regardless of Bolek's main axis choice, Lolek's half-lines are horizontal and vertical. Wait, but if Bolek chooses the main axis as vertical, then Lolek draws horizontal and vertical half-lines. If Bolek chooses main axis as horizontal, same thing. So, regardless of Bolek's main axis, Lolek's half-lines are horizontal and vertical. Therefore, the orientation of the half-lines is fixed as horizontal and vertical. Therefore, the problem reduces to: given 2n points in general position (no two on the same vertical or horizontal line), what is the maximum number of regions that can be created by drawing two horizontal and two vertical half-lines from each point, from the perspective of Lolek, who must choose the direction of the half-lines (horizontal/vertical) such that the number of regions is maximized. However, since Lolek can choose the direction (horizontal/vertical), but the main axis is fixed as either vertical or horizontal, but Lolek can choose which one?\n\nWait, no. Wait, let me parse again:\n\n\"Lolek, for each of these 2n points, draws two half-lines: one from the point on the line perpendicular to the main axis, and one on the axis itself.\"\n\nSo, given that Bolek has chosen a main axis (say, horizontal), then from each point, one half-line is perpendicular to the main axis (vertical), and the other is along the main axis (horizontal). Therefore, the half-lines are vertical and horizontal. Similarly, if the main axis is vertical, then the half-lines are horizontal and vertical. Therefore, regardless of Bolek's choice of main axis, Lolek's half-lines are horizontal and vertical. Therefore, the orientation is fixed as horizontal/vertical. So, Lolek has to draw two horizontal and two vertical half-lines, one in each direction. But the problem says \"regardless of the position of points drawn by Bolek,\" so Lolek wants to choose the direction (horizontal/vertical) such that, regardless of how Bolek has arranged his points (as long as they are in general position, no two on the same vertical or horizontal), the number of regions is at least k. Therefore, Lolek can choose either direction (horizontal/vertical) for his half-lines, but the problem is to find the maximum k such that for any arrangement of Bolek's points, Lolek can choose one direction (horizontal/vertical) to get at least k regions.\n\nBut wait, if Lolek can choose the direction (horizontal/vertical), but he has to fix the direction, then the number of regions depends on how the half-lines intersect. However, if he can choose the direction, then depending on the direction, the number of regions can vary.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is that Lolek can choose whether to make the half-lines horizontal/vertical or vertical/horizontal, but since the main axis is fixed by Bolek, but Lolek can choose the direction. Wait, no. The problem says \"the half-lines are drawn from the point on the line perpendicular to the main axis, and on the axis itself.\" So, for each point, one half-line is perpendicular to the main axis, and the other is along the main axis. Therefore, the half-lines are perpendicular to the main axis and along it. So, if Bolek chooses the main axis as the horizontal axis, then Lolek draws vertical half-lines (perpendicular) and horizontal half-lines (along). If Bolek chooses the main axis as vertical, then Lolek draws horizontal half-lines (perpendicular) and vertical half-lines (along).\n\nTherefore, the half-lines are always horizontal/vertical, one in each direction, regardless of Bolek's main axis choice. Therefore, Lolek's half-lines are fixed as horizontal/vertical. So, the orientation is fixed. Then, the problem is: given 2n points in general position (no two on the same vertical or horizontal line), how many regions can be formed by drawing two horizontal and two vertical half-lines (one in each direction), and what is the maximum number k such that, regardless of the 2n points, Lolek can choose one direction (horizontal/vertical) to get at least k regions.\n\nBut wait, if Lolek has to choose one direction for both pairs of half-lines (horizontal/vertical), then depending on the main axis chosen by Bolek, the direction is fixed. For example, if Bolek chooses the main axis as horizontal, then Lolek must draw vertical and horizontal half-lines. If Bolek chooses the main axis as vertical, then Lolek must draw horizontal and vertical half-lines.\n\nHowever, the problem states", "answer": "Ponieważ\n\n\\[\n\\binom{b}{2} \\leq \\frac{b^2}{2}, \\quad \\binom{d}{2} \\leq \\frac{d^2}{2}, \\quad ac \\leq \\frac{a^2 + c^2}{2}, \\quad 0 \\leq bd,\n\\]\n\nwięc\n\n\\[\nT \\leq \\frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2}{2} + ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd = \\frac{(a + b + c + d)^2}{2} = 2n^2,\n\\]\n\nco pokazuje, że Lolek może uzyskać co najwyżej \\( 2n^2 \\) punktów przecięcia elek."}

Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem. We have a sequence of numbers from 1 to n, each multiplied by either 1 or -1, and their sum should be zero. So essentially, we need the sum of these terms to cancel out perfectly. Since each term is either positive or negative, the total sum must be zero. That means the positive parts and the negative parts of the sum must balance each other.\n\nLet me denote the sum as S = Σ_{k=1}^n k·s_k = 0. Since each s_k is ±1, this is equivalent to saying that the sum of the positive terms minus the sum of the negative terms equals zero. Let's denote the sum of the positive terms as P and the sum of the negative terms as N. Then P - N = 0, which implies P = N. But the total sum of all terms from 1 to n is S_total = Σ_{k=1}^n k = n(n+1)/2. Since P + N = n(n+1)/2 and P = N, substituting gives 2P = n(n+1)/2, so P = n(n+1)/4. Therefore, for such a partition to exist, n(n+1)/4 must be an integer because P has to be an integer (since it's the sum of integers). Wait, but n and n+1 are consecutive integers, so one of them is even, meaning n(n+1) is always even. Therefore, n(n+1)/4 must be an integer only if n(n+1) is divisible by 4. So n(n+1) ≡ 0 mod 4. Let's check when this happens.\n\nSince n and n+1 are consecutive, one of them is even. For their product to be divisible by 4, either n is divisible by 4 or n+1 is divisible by 4. Because if n is even, then n+1 is odd, so n must contribute a 2 to make the product divisible by 4. Similarly, if n+1 is even, then n is odd, so n must be divisible by 4. Therefore, n ≡ 0 or 3 mod 4. Wait, let me verify:\n\nIf n ≡ 0 mod 4: Then n is divisible by 4, so n = 4k. Then n+1 = 4k +1, which is odd. Then n(n+1)/4 = 4k(4k+1)/4 = k(4k+1), which is integer.\n\nIf n ≡ 3 mod 4: Then n = 4k +3. Then n+1 = 4k +4 = 4(k+1), which is divisible by 4. Then n(n+1)/4 = (4k +3)(4(k+1))/4 = (4k +3)(k+1), which is also an integer.\n\nIf n ≡1 mod4: Then n is odd, and n+1 is even. Then n(n+1)/4 = (1 mod4)(2 mod4)/4. Since n is odd, n=2m+1. Then (2m+1)(2m+2)/4 = (2m+1)(m+1). Which is integer, but does this product necessarily have to be even? Let's see. For example, take n=1: 1(2)/4 = 0.5, not integer. But n=1: The sum would be 1·s₁ =0, which is impossible because s₁ is ±1. So n=1 isn't allowed. Similarly, n=3: 3·4/4=3, which is integer. Let's check n=3. Can we have 1·s₁ +2·s₂ +3·s₃ =0? Let's see. Suppose s₁=1, then 1 +2s₂ +3s₃ =0. Then 2s₂ +3s₃ = -1. Let's see possible combinations. If s₃=1, then 2s₂ +3 = -1 ⇒ 2s₂ = -4 ⇒ s₂= -2, which is impossible. If s₃=-1, then 2s₂ -3 = -1 ⇒ 2s₂ =2 ⇒ s₂=1. Then s₁=1, s₂=1, s₃=-1: 1 +2 + (-3) =0. Wait, that works! So n=3 is possible. So n=3 is allowed, but according to the previous analysis, n=3 is 3 mod4, which is allowed. So the earlier conclusion that n ≡0 or3 mod4 is correct. But wait, n=1: 1 mod4=1, but n=1 is not allowed. So maybe the conclusion is n ≡0 or3 mod4, but n=1 is an exception. Let's check n=7: 7 mod4=3. Let's see if n=7 is possible. Let's try constructing such a sequence. Maybe this is getting complicated. Maybe there's another condition.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user is asking for all positive integers n where such s₁,...,s_n exist. So my initial conclusion that n(n+1)/4 must be an integer is necessary, but is it sufficient? Because even if n(n+1)/4 is an integer, we still need to have a subset of the numbers 1 to n that sum to n(n+1)/4. Wait, but actually, the sum of the positive terms P is n(n+1)/4, and the sum of the negative terms N is also n(n+1)/4. So we need that there exists a subset of {1,2,...,n} which sums to n(n+1)/4.\n\nWait, that's a different way to think about it. If we can find a subset of the numbers 1 to n that sums to S = n(n+1)/4, then the remaining numbers will also sum to S, and the total sum will be zero. So the problem reduces to finding whether the subset sum S = n(n+1)/4 is achievable with the numbers 1 to n.\n\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to: For which n does there exist a subset of {1,2,...,n} that sums to n(n+1)/4?\n\nThis is a classic subset sum problem. The question is, for which n does the subset sum of n(n+1)/4 exist?\n\nBut the subset sum problem is NP-hard in general, but perhaps for these specific numbers (sum of 1 to n is n(n+1)/2, so half of that is n(n+1)/4), the question is when such a subset exists. For the subset sum to exist, n(n+1)/4 must be at least the sum of the smallest numbers, but actually, the subset sum can be achieved if the target is between the minimum and maximum possible subset sums.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a known result for this particular case. Let me recall that the problem of determining whether a subset of {1,2,...,n} sums to a target S is a classic problem. For example, the subset sum problem is often approached via dynamic programming, but in this case, the target is n(n+1)/4. However, for specific values of n, this might be possible or impossible.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a better approach. Let's consider that the sum S = n(n+1)/4. For S to be achievable, it must be at least the sum of the smallest n/2 numbers? Wait, not necessarily. For example, S could be achieved by a combination of larger numbers. Alternatively, maybe there's a parity condition?\n\nWait, let's take n=3. Then S=3*4/4=3. The numbers are 1,2,3. The subset that sums to 3 would be {3}, which works. For n=4: S=4*5/4=5. The numbers are 1,2,3,4. The subset that sums to 5 is {1,4} or {2,3}. Either way, possible. For n=5: S=5*6/4=7.5, which is not integer. But n=5 is 5 mod4=1, but n(n+1)/4=15/4=3.75, which is not integer. So n=5 is excluded. Wait, but n=5: 5*6/4=15/2=7.5, which is not integer. So n=5 is excluded. Wait, but earlier I thought that n must be 0 or3 mod4. So n=5 is 1 mod4, which is excluded. So maybe the necessary and sufficient condition is that n(n+1)/4 is an integer and also that there exists a subset sum S.\n\nBut how do we check if such a subset exists? Maybe there's a theorem here. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is equivalent to the existence of a partition of {1,2,...,n} into two subsets with equal sum, but only when the total sum is even. Wait, the total sum is n(n+1)/2. So if we need to split into two equal subsets, the total sum must be even, i.e., n(n+1)/2 is even. Then n(n+1)/2 ≡0 mod2 ⇒ n(n+1) ≡0 mod4. Which is same as n ≡0 or3 mod4. Wait, because n and n+1 are consecutive, so one is even. For n(n+1) divisible by 4, either n or n+1 must be divisible by 4. So n ≡0 or3 mod4. Therefore, if n ≡0 or3 mod4, then the total sum is even, so a partition into two subsets with equal sum is possible. However, the problem here is not about partitioning into two subsets with equal sum, but about partitioning into two subsets with sums S and -S, which is equivalent. But in our problem, the subset sum is S = n(n+1)/4. So if a subset sum of S exists, then such a partition is possible. However, the existence of a subset sum S doesn't necessarily require the total sum to be even. Wait, no. Because if the total sum is even, then S = total/2. If the total sum is odd, then S is not an integer, so such a subset sum cannot exist.\n\nWait, hold on. If the total sum is even, then S = total/2 is integer, and if the total sum is odd, S is not integer, so such a subset sum doesn't exist. Therefore, the necessary condition is that the total sum is even, which happens when n ≡0 or3 mod4. But is that also sufficient? For example, with n=1: total sum=1, which is odd, so no. n=2: total sum=3, which is odd. n=3: total sum=6, which is even, so S=3. And we saw that n=3 is possible. n=4: total sum=10, S=5. Possible. n=5: total sum=15, which is odd, so no. n=6: total sum=21, which is odd, so no. n=7: total sum=28, which is even, so S=14. Let's check if 14 can be achieved with numbers 1-7. Let's try. 7+6+1=14. Yes, 7+6+1=14. So n=7 is possible. Similarly, n=8: total sum=36, S=18. Can we get 18? 8+7+5=20. 8+7+4=19. 8+6+5+3=22. 8+5+4+3+2=22. Wait, maybe 8+7+3=18. 8+7+3=18. Yes. So n=8 is possible. Hmm, so even when n ≡0 mod4, like n=4,8, the subset sum S exists. For n=3,7, which are 3 mod4, it also works. So maybe the necessary and sufficient condition is that n ≡0 or3 mod4. But wait, let's check n=12. Total sum=78, S=39. Let's see if 39 can be achieved. For example, 12+11+10+6=39. 12+11+9=32. 12+10+9+8=39. Yes. So n=12 is possible. So seems like when n ≡0 or3 mod4, the subset sum S exists. But how to prove this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let's think about the problem in terms of the parity. For n ≡0 or3 mod4, the number of elements is divisible by4 (if n≡0 mod4) or n+1 is divisible by4 (if n≡3 mod4). Wait, n+1 being divisible by4 when n≡3 mod4. So perhaps for n≡0 mod4, n=4k, and for n≡3 mod4, n=4k+3. Maybe there's a way to pair numbers or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is equivalent to the existence of a subset of {1,2,...,n} that sums to S = n(n+1)/4. Let's consider that S must be at least the average of the numbers. The average of the numbers 1 to n is (n+1)/2. So S must be at least (n+1)/2. Let's check for n=3: S=3, which is equal to (3+1)/2=2. So 3 ≥2, okay. For n=7: S=14, average is (7+1)/2=4, 14 ≥4. For n=8: S=18, average is (8+1)/2=4.5, 18 ≥4.5. So S is always at least the average. But does this guarantee the existence of a subset sum? Not necessarily. For example, take n=7: numbers 1-7. The average is 4, but the subset sum is 14, which is exactly 3.5 times the average. But maybe there's a way to choose numbers. For n=7, as I found earlier, 7+6+1=14. So that works. Similarly, for n=8: 8+7+3=18.

Wait, but if \\(b = c\\), then substituting back into the original equations might lead to a solution. Let's check that possibility later. For now, note that from the first subtraction, we have two cases: either a = c or a + c + 4b = 0.\n\nSimilarly, subtract equation 3 from equation 2:\n\n\\(b^2 + 4bc + c^2 - (c^2 + 4ca + a^2) = 1 - (-2)\\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\(b^2 + 4bc - 4ca - a^2 = 3\\)\n\nAgain, let's factor:\n\nMaybe group terms:\n\n\\(b^2 - a^2 + 4bc - 4ca = 3\\)\n\nFactor:\n\n\\((b - a)(b + a) + 4c(b - a) = 3\\)\n\nFactor out (b - a):\n\n\\((b - a)(b + a + 4c) = 3\\)\n\nSo either \\(b = a\\) or \\(b + a + 4c = \\frac{3}{b - a}\\). Hmm, again two cases.\n\nSo from subtracting the equations, we have multiple cases. Let's try to analyze these cases.\n\nCase 1: a = c\n\nIf a = c, then substitute a = c into the original equations.\n\nEquation 1: \\(a^2 + 4ab + b^2 = 1\\)\n\nEquation 3: \\(a^2 + 4a^2 + a^2 = -2\\) (since c = a and c^2 is a^2, and 4ca is 4a^2)\n\nWait, equation 3 would be:\n\n\\(a^2 + 4a*a + a^2 = -2\\) → \\(a^2 + 4a^2 + a^2 = -2\\) → \\(6a^2 = -2\\) → \\(a^2 = -1/3\\). But a is real, so no solution here. Therefore, Case 1 (a = c) leads to a contradiction. Thus, a ≠ c.\n\nCase 2: a + c + 4b = 0\n\nSo, a + c = -4b.\n\nLet me note this as equation (4): a + c = -4b.\n\nSimilarly, from subtracting equation 3 from equation 2, we have two cases: b = a or \\(b + a + 4c = 3/(b - a)\\). Let's handle both cases.\n\nCase 2.1: b = a\n\nIf b = a, then substitute b = a into equation 1:\n\n\\(a^2 + 4a^2 + a^2 = 1\\) → \\(6a^2 = 1\\) → \\(a^2 = 1/6\\) → a = ±1/√6. Then, since b = a, c = -4b - a = -4a - a = -5a. But wait, from equation 2: \\(b^2 + 4bc + c^2 = 1\\). Since b = a and c = -5a:\n\n\\(a^2 + 4a(-5a) + (-5a)^2 = 1\\) → \\(a^2 -20a^2 +25a^2 = 6a^2 =1\\) → same as before, which checks out. Then, check equation 3: \\(c^2 +4ca +a^2 = (-5a)^2 +4*(-5a)*a +a^2 =25a^2 -20a^2 +a^2=6a^2=1, which matches. So this gives a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, in Case 2.1, we have a = ±1/√6, b = a, c = -5a.\n\nCase 2.2: \\(b + a + 4c = 3/(b - a)\\)\n\nThis seems more complicated. Let's denote this as equation (5): \\(b + a + 4c = 3/(b - a)\\).\n\nBut we also have from equation (4): a + c = -4b. So we can express c in terms of a and b: c = -4b - a.\n\nSubstitute c = -4b - a into equation (5):\n\n\\(b + a + 4*(-4b - a) = 3/(b - a)\\)\n\nSimplify left side:\n\nb + a -16b -4a = (-15b -3a) = 3/(b - a)\n\nSo:\n\n-15b -3a = 3/(b - a)\n\nMultiply both sides by (b - a):\n\n(-15b -3a)(b - a) = 3\n\nLet me expand the left side:\n\n-15b(b - a) -3a(b - a) = -15b² +15ab -3ab +3a² = -15b² +12ab +3a² =3\n\nSo:\n\n-15b² +12ab +3a² =3\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n-5b² +4ab +a² =1\n\nNow, recall from equation 1: \\(a^2 +4ab +b^2 =1\\). Let's write both equations:\n\nEquation 1: \\(a^2 +4ab +b^2 =1\\)\n\nEquation derived from Case 2.2: \\(-5b² +4ab +a² =1\\)\n\nSubtract equation 1 from the derived equation:\n\n(-5b² +4ab +a²) - (a² +4ab +b²) =1 -1\n\nSimplify:\n\n-5b² +4ab +a² -a² -4ab -b² =0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-6b² =0 → b²=0 → b=0\n\nSo, in Case 2.2, we get b=0. Then substitute back into equation (4): a + c = -4b =0 → a + c =0 → c = -a.\n\nAlso, from equation 1: \\(a^2 +4ab +b^2 =1\\). Since b=0, this becomes \\(a²=1\\) → a=±1. Then c = -a, so c=∓1.\n\nCheck these solutions in equation 2: \\(b² +4bc +c² =0 +0 +c² =c²=1\\), which is satisfied since c=±1.\n\nCheck equation 3: \\(c² +4ca +a² =1 +4*(-a)*a +a² =1 -4a² +a² =1 -3a². But a²=1, so 1 -3= -2. Which matches equation 3. So these solutions are valid.\n\nTherefore, in Case 2.2, we have two solutions: (a, b, c) = (1, 0, -1) and (-1, 0, 1).\n\nNow, let's check if there are other possibilities in Case 2.2. Wait, in Case 2.2, we assumed that \\(b + a +4c =3/(b -a)\\). But when we solved, we found that b=0, leading to a=±1, c=∓1. So that's all. So these are the only solutions in Case 2.2.\n\nSo, summarizing the cases:\n\nCase 1: a = c leads to no solution.\n\nCase 2: a + c +4b =0. This splits into Case 2.1 (b=a) and Case 2.2 (b=0). Case 2.1 gives two solutions, Case 2.2 gives two solutions.\n\nNow, let's check all solutions in the original equations to ensure they satisfy all three equations.\n\nFirst, the solutions from Case 2.1: (a, b, c) = (1/√6, 1/√6, -5/√6) and (-1/√6, -1/√6, 5/√6).\n\nCheck equation 1: \\(a² +4ab +b² = (1/6) +4*(1/√6)*(1/√6) + (1/6) = 1/6 + 4*(1/6) +1/6 =1/6 +2/3 +1/6= (1 +4 +1)/6=6/6=1. Correct.\n\nEquation 2: \\(b² +4bc +c² = (1/6) +4*(1/√6)*(-5/√6) + (25/6) =1/6 -20/6 +25/6= (1 -20 +25)/6=6/6=1. Correct.\n\nEquation 3: \\(c² +4ca +a² =25/6 +4*(-5/√6)*(1/√6) +1/6=25/6 -20/6 +1/6=6/6=1. Wait, equation 3 is supposed to be -2. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, wait, no. Wait, equation 3 was given as c² +4ca +a² = -2. But according to this calculation, it's 25/6 -20/6 +1/6 =6/6=1. Wait, that's 1, but the equation says -2. So this is a contradiction.\n\nWait, this can't be. Did I miscalculate?\n\nWait, let's recalculate equation 3 for (a, b, c) = (1/√6, 1/√6, -5/√6):\n\nc² +4ca +a² = (-5/√6)^2 +4*(-5/√6)*(1/√6) + (1/√6)^2\n\n=25/6 +4*(-5/6) +1/6\n\n=25/6 -20/6 +1/6 =6/6=1. But equation 3 requires this to be -2. So there's a problem here. Wait, this suggests that even though we followed the equations, the solution does not satisfy equation 3, which is a contradiction. Therefore, this solution is invalid. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the algebra when deriving equation 3.\n\nLet me re-examine the process.\n\nFrom Case 2.1: a = b, c = -5a.\n\nEquation 1: a² +4a² +a²=6a²=1 → a²=1/6 → a=±1/√6.\n\nEquation 3: c² +4ca +a². Since c= -5a, substitute:\n\n(-5a)^2 +4*(-5a)*a +a² =25a² -20a² +a²=6a²=6*(1/6)=1. But equation 3 is supposed to be -2. Therefore, this is a contradiction. Therefore, even though equations 1 and 2 are satisfied, equation 3 is not. Therefore, this solution is invalid. Therefore, Case 2.1 does not lead to a valid solution.\n\nWait, so why did we get this solution? Because when we subtracted equation 3 from equation 1, we supposed a = c, but in reality, if a = c, then equation 3 is 6a² =1, which is invalid. Therefore, even though equations 1 and 2 are satisfied, equation 3 is not. Therefore, this solution is extraneous and must be discarded. So Case 2.1 does not yield a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, only Case 2.2 gives valid solutions.\n\nNow, the solutions from Case 2.2 are (1, 0, -1) and (-1, 0, 1). Let's check equation 3 for these solutions.\n\nFor (1, 0, -1):\n\nEquation 3: (-1)^2 +4*1*(-1) +1^2 =1 -4 +1= -2. Correct.\n\nFor (-1, 0, 1):\n\n(1)^2 +4*(-1)*1 +", "answer": "Porównując lewe strony pierwszego i drugiego równania otrzymujemy  \n\\[ a^2 + 4ab = 4bc + c^2, \\]  \nskąd  \n\\[ 0 = a^2 - c^2 + 4ab - 4bc = (a - c)(a + c + 4b). \\]  \n\nJeśli \\( a - c = 0 \\), to \\( a = c \\) i trzecie równanie przyjmuje postać \\( 6a^2 = -2 \\).  \nTo jest sprzeczność, bo kwadrat liczby rzeczywistej nie może być ujemny.  \nW takim razie \\( a - c \\neq 0 \\), wobec czego \\( a + c + 4b = 0 \\).  \n\nZ drugiej strony, dodając stronami wszystkie trzy równania dostajemy  \n\\[ 2(a + b + c)^2 = 0, \\]  \nskąd \\( a + b + c = 0 \\).  \n\nOtrzymane związki dają \\( 3b = (a + c + 4b) - (a + b + c) = 0 \\),  \nwięc \\( b = 0 \\).

Hmm, interesting problem. Let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have an infinite chessboard, which means it's like an endless grid of cells. We need to assign each cell a number from the set A, which has exactly mn elements. The key condition is that any m x n or n x m rectangle, which has mn cells, must contain each number exactly once. So, if I pick any such rectangle, no matter where I place it on the infinite chessboard, the numbers in those mn cells must be exactly the numbers 1 through mn, each appearing once.\n\nWait, but the chessboard is infinite, so there's no boundary. That complicates things because the rectangle can be placed anywhere. So the placement has to be such that every possible m x n or n x m block, no matter where it's placed, has all numbers from 1 to mn without repetition. That seems like a very strict condition. Let me think about smaller cases first to get some intuition.\n\nLet's consider m = 1 and n = 1. Then the set A = {1}, and the condition is that every 1x1 or 1x1 rectangle (which is just a single cell) must contain the number 1. But since the chessboard is infinite, we can just place 1 in every cell. That works. So (1,1) is a valid pair.\n\nHow about m = 2 and n = 2? Then A = {1, 2, 3, 4}. The condition is that every 2x2 rectangle must contain all four numbers 1, 2, 3, 4. Similarly, every 2x2 rectangle (since m = n = 2) must have each number exactly once. So this is similar to a Latin square of order 2. In a Latin square, each row and column contains each number exactly once. But in this case, the condition is only for the 2x2 rectangles. However, in a Latin square, every 2x2 square (if it's a subsquare) would also need to have all numbers, but actually, in a Latin square, the entire square might not be Latin, but each 2x2 subgrid would. Wait, maybe not necessarily. Let me check.\n\nSuppose we have a Latin square of order 2, like:\n\n1 2\n\n2 1\n\nBut if we take the 2x2 square starting at the top left, it's the entire square, which is Latin. But if we take the square starting at the cell (1,2), then the 2x2 square would be:\n\n2 1\n\n1 2\n\nWhich is also Latin. Wait, actually, in a Latin square of order 2, every 2x2 subgrid is Latin. Because each row and column has 1 and 2, so any two rows and two columns will also contain 1 and 2. So in that case, (2,2) is a valid pair. But is this the only case? Let's think.\n\nSuppose we have a 2x2 Latin square. Then yes, it satisfies the condition. But what if we have a different arrangement? Suppose we have:\n\n1 3\n\n2 4\n\nThen, if we take the 2x2 square starting at (1,1), it's [1,3; 2,4], which contains 1,3,2,4. All numbers 1-4. But if we take another 2x2 square, say starting at (2,2), the square is [4], but wait, that's only one cell. Wait, no, the chessboard is infinite, so every 2x2 square must be filled with all four numbers. Wait, but in this case, if we have a 2x2 square with numbers 1,3,2,4, then the next 2x2 square starting at (2,1) would be:\n\n3 4\n\n2 1\n\nWhich contains 3,4,2,1. All numbers 1-4. So in this case, even though the first square has a 3, the next square has 4, which is okay. Wait, but in this case, the entire chessboard is filled with numbers 1,2,3,4 in some order, such that every 2x2 square is a permutation of 1-4. So maybe this is possible.\n\nBut actually, in that case, the numbers are arranged in a way that every 2x2 block is a Latin square. So perhaps for prime numbers, or some other condition? Wait, maybe not. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the above example, the entire grid is filled with numbers 1,2,3,4 arranged such that every 2x2 square is a Latin square. But in reality, if you arrange them in a grid where each 2x2 block is Latin, then the entire grid must be constructed such that overlapping 2x2 blocks each satisfy the Latin square condition. This is similar to a de Bruijn sequence but in two dimensions. Wait, maybe this is related to tiling the plane with Latin squares.\n\nBut let me think again. If we can tile the infinite chessboard with Latin squares of size m x n, then that would satisfy the condition. However, tiling the plane with Latin squares is non-trivial. For example, a Latin square of order m x n can be tiled if and only if m and n are coprime? Wait, no. Wait, actually, tiling the plane with Latin squares is possible only if the Latin squares are toroidal, meaning that the grid wraps around, but since we have an infinite chessboard, that's not the case. So perhaps another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is equivalent to constructing a global numbering of the chessboard such that every m x n rectangle is a Latin square. But Latin squares have the property that each number appears exactly once in each row and column. However, in our problem, the condition is stronger: every m x n rectangle must contain each number exactly once, regardless of their positions. So this is a different condition.\n\nWait, but if every m x n rectangle must contain each number exactly once, then in particular, each row and column must contain each number exactly once in those rectangles. Wait, but rows and columns aren't necessarily covered by every m x n rectangle. For example, in a 2x3 rectangle, a row might not be entirely contained. Hmm, this is getting confusing.\n\nLet me consider the problem again. The set A has mn elements. We need to assign each cell a number from A such that any m x n or n x m rectangle contains each number exactly once. So, for any such rectangle, the multiset of numbers in it is exactly {1, 2, ..., mn}, each appearing once.\n\nSo, in particular, every cell is part of multiple rectangles. For example, a single cell is part of many rectangles. Each time it's in a rectangle, it must be assigned a number that doesn't conflict with the numbers in the other cells of that rectangle.\n\nWait, but how can a single cell be part of multiple rectangles? For example, in an infinite chessboard, any cell is in infinitely many m x n rectangles. Each of these rectangles would require the cell to have a number different from the other numbers in their respective rectangles. This seems like a very strong condition. Maybe there's a way to construct such a numbering, or maybe it's only possible for certain m and n.\n\nLet me think about the case when m = n. So the set A is {1, 2, ..., m^2}. Then the condition is that every m x m rectangle contains all numbers from 1 to m^2 exactly once. So this is similar to a Latin square of order m, but extended to 2D. In a Latin square, each row and column contains each number exactly once. But here, the condition is about every m x m square, not just rows or columns.\n\nWait, but in a Latin square, any m x m square (as long as it's a subsquare) would contain each number exactly once. Wait, is that true? Let me check. Take a Latin square of order 3:\n\n1 2 3\n\n2 3 1\n\n3 1 2\n\nIf I take the top-left 2x2 square:\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\nThis has numbers 1,2,2,3. Wait, that's duplicates. So in a Latin square, the subsquares (properly) may not be Latin. For example, a 3x3 Latin square has the property that every 2x2 subgrid is also Latin. Wait, let me check:\n\nTake the top-left 2x2 subgrid of the Latin square above:\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\nThis is indeed Latin, as each number 1,2,3 appears once in each row and column. Wait, but the 2x2 subgrid contains numbers 1,2,2,3. Wait, no, the numbers are 1,2,2,3? Wait, no, the original Latin square has numbers 1,2,3 in each row and column. So the top-left 2x2 subgrid would be:\n\n1 2\n\n2 3\n\nBut in this case, the number 2 appears twice? Wait, no, in the Latin square, each number appears exactly once per row and column. So in the 3x3 Latin square, each row and column has 1,2,3. So the top-left 2x2 subgrid would have numbers 1,2 from the first row and 2,3 from the second row. Wait, but the second row's first element is 2, which is the same as the first row's second element. So in the 2x2 subgrid, the numbers are 1,2,2,3. That's two 2s. So it's not Latin. Therefore, my initial thought was wrong. So in some Latin squares, the subsquares may not be Latin. Therefore, perhaps the condition is stronger.\n\nWait, so maybe the problem requires that every m x n rectangle, regardless of position, contains each number exactly once. That is, not just the subsquares, but any rectangle of size m x n. Therefore, the numbering must be such that in every such rectangle, all numbers are present. This is a much stronger condition.\n\nThis seems similar to a concept in combinatorics called \"covering designs\" or \"universal cycles\", but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's similar to a permutation matrix with additional constraints.\n\nWait, but how can a single number be placed in such a way that it doesn't conflict with other numbers in any m x n or n x m rectangle? That seems impossible unless the number is unique in every possible rectangle. But since the chessboard is infinite, each cell is in infinitely many rectangles. Therefore, each cell must contain a number that doesn't appear in any other cell in any of its rectangles. However, since the chessboard is infinite, there's no way to assign numbers to each cell without overlapping in some rectangles. Therefore, this seems impossible unless the grid is finite, but the problem states it's infinite.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to assign numbers such that each number is only present in a unique position. But the problem allows multiple cells to have the same number, as long as they are not in the same m x n or n x m rectangle. Wait, no, the condition is that every m x n or n x m rectangle must contain each number exactly once. So if two cells have the same number, they must be in different m x n or n x m rectangles. But since the chessboard is infinite, every cell is in infinitely many rectangles, so the same number would have to appear in infinitely many different rectangles, which is impossible because the chessboard is infinite but each rectangle is finite. Wait, but each number can only appear once in each rectangle. So if two cells have the same number, then they cannot be in the same rectangle. But since every cell is in infinitely many rectangles, that would mean that each number can only appear once in the entire grid. But the problem states that the set A has mn elements, so each number from 1 to mn must appear exactly once. Therefore, the entire grid must be a bijection from the set of cells to the set A. Therefore, the grid is a Latin square? Wait, but not necessarily. Because the condition is about rectangles, not rows or columns.\n\nWait, but if the entire grid is a Latin square, then every row and column contains each number exactly once. However, it's not clear whether this would satisfy the 2D rectangle condition. For example, in a Latin square, a 2x2 subgrid might not be Latin. As we saw earlier, a Latin square of order 3 has some 2x2 subgrids that are not Latin.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the only way to satisfy the condition is if the numbering is such that each number appears exactly once in every m x n rectangle. Which would mean that the numbering is a \"covering\" of the grid with Latin squares? But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only possible when m and n are coprime. Wait, for example, if m and n are coprime, then perhaps we can tile the grid in such a way that the coloring repeats every m and n cells, satisfying the Latin square condition. But I need to think more carefully.\n\nWait, let's consider the case when m = 1. Then the condition is that every 1 x n or n x 1 rectangle (which is just a row or column) must contain all numbers from 1 to n. But the chessboard is infinite. So if we can assign numbers to each row such that every n consecutive numbers in a row are a permutation of 1 to n, and similarly for columns, then it works. But this is similar to a Latin square but for rows and columns. Wait, no, if each row is a permutation of 1 to n, and each column is also a permutation of 1 to n, then it's a Latin square. But if we can do this for both rows and columns, then the entire grid can be assigned such numbers. However, in the problem, the condition is only on the rectangles of size m x n or n x m, which in this case is 1 x n or n x 1. So it's similar to having each column being a permutation of 1 to n, and each row being a permutation of 1 to n. But such a grid is just a Latin square. Therefore, if A = {1, 2, ..., n}, then (1, n) is a valid pair if and only if n is any positive integer. Wait, but the problem states m and n are positive integers, so m = 1 and n arbitrary. But the problem requires A = {1, 2, ..., mn}, so when m = 1, A = {1, 2, ..., n}, and the condition is that every 1 x n or n x ", "answer": "y mod n = y' mod n oraz (x - y) mod m = (x' - y') mod m.\n\nTo zaś jest równoważne temu, że n dzieli liczbę y − y′ oraz m dzieli liczbę x − y − (x′ − y′) = (x − x′) − (y − y′).\n\nWykazujemy, że każdy prostokąt m × n przykrywa parami różne liczby. Należy pokazać, że jeśli |x − x′| < m, |y − y′| < n i f(x, y) = f(x′, y′), to x = x′ i y = y′. Na mocy obserwacji poczynionej powyżej, liczba y − y′ dzieli się przez n, a liczba (x − x′) − (y − y′) dzieli się przez m. Jedyną liczbą o module mniejszym od n podzielną przez n jest 0 — zatem y−y′ = 0. Wtedy (x−x′)−(y−y′) = x−x′ jest podzielną przez m liczbą o module mniejszym od m — zatem x−x′ = 0. Ostatecznie x = x′ i y = y′.\n\nTeraz wykazujemy, że każdy prostokąt n × m przykrywa parami różne liczby. Należy pokazać, że z warunków |x − x′| < n, |y − y′| < m i f(x, y) = f(x′, y′) wynika, że x = x′ i y = y′. Analogicznie jak wyżej stwierdzamy, że y−y′ dzieli się przez n oraz że (x−x′)−(y−y′) dzieli się przez m. Liczba m dzieli się przez n, więc n dzieli liczbę (x−x′)−(y−y′), a skoro n dzieli y − y′, to musi też dzielić x − x′. Ponieważ x − x′ jest podzielna przez n liczbą o module mniejszym od n, więc x − x′ = 0. Stąd wniosek, że liczba (x − x′) − (y − y′) jest równa y′ − y. Jest ona podzielna przez m i ma moduł mniejszy od m, więc y′ − y = 0. Otrzymaliśmy zatem x = x′ i y = y′."}

Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem better.\n\nFirst, the question is about numbers that can't be expressed as the sum of a square of a nonnegative integer and a prime. So, for example, numbers like 2 can be written as 1² + 1 (since 1 is not prime, wait, that doesn't work. Wait, primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. So 1 isn't considered a prime. So maybe 2 can be written as 1² + 1, but since 1 isn't prime, that doesn't count. Then maybe 2 can't be written in such a way. Let's check small numbers first.\n\nLet's list some numbers and see which can be expressed as n² + p.\n\nStarting with n=0: Then the expression becomes 0 + p, which is just prime numbers. So all primes can be expressed in this form. But primes are infinite, so that's straightforward.\n\nn=1: Then the expression is 1 + p. So numbers like 1 + 2 = 3, which is prime, 1 + 3 = 4, which is composite. Wait, but 4 can be written as 1² + 3 (3 is prime). So 4 is okay. Hmm. So 1 + p must be composite. Wait, but primes are primes, so 3 is prime, 4 is composite. So if p is such that 1 + p is composite, then 1 + p can be written as n² + p. So primes p where p + 1 is composite. For example, p=2: 2 + 1 = 3 (prime). Not okay. p=3: 3 +1 =4 (composite). So 4 can be written as 1² +3. So 4 is okay. p=5: 5+1=6 (composite). So 6 can be written as 1² +5. Wait, but 6 is 1² +5, so 6 can be written as such. So 6 is okay.\n\nWait, but primes p where p+1 is composite. So p must be even? Because primes except 2 are odd. Wait, 2 is the only even prime. So p=2: 2 +1=3 (prime). Not okay. p=3: 3+1=4 (composite). So 4 is okay. p=5: 6 (composite). So 6 is okay. So maybe numbers that are one more than a prime are composite, except when the prime is 2, which gives 3. So in that case, 2 +1=3, which is prime. So primes like p where p +1 is prime would be problematic. So for example, if p +1 is prime, then n² + p = (n²) + (p) = (n)² + (prime). So if p +1 is prime, then this would not work. So we need to avoid numbers that are p +1 where p is prime. Wait, but n is 1 here. So if p is prime, then p +1 is one more than a prime. So numbers that are one more than a prime can't be written as 1² + p. So for example, 3 is prime, so 3 +1=4. So 4 can be written as 1² +3. So 4 is okay. Wait, but 4 is also 2², but 2 is a prime. Wait, 4 can be written as 2² +0, but n has to be nonnegative, so 0 is allowed. Wait, but 0 is not a prime. So n=2: 2² +0, but 0 is not prime. So maybe n=2: 4 +0=4. But 0 is not considered a prime. So 4 can be written as 2² +0, but since 0 is not prime, that doesn't count. So 4 can be written as 1² +3, which is allowed. So 4 is okay.\n\nWait, so the problem is that numbers which are one more than a prime (p +1) cannot be written as 1² + p. So if p is a prime, then p +1 is not prime (except when p=2, p +1=3, which is prime). So 2 +1=3, which is prime. So 3 can't be written as 1² + p. So 3 is a number that can't be expressed in that form. Wait, but 3 is a prime. Wait, but the question is about numbers that can't be expressed as n² + p, where n is a nonnegative integer and p is a prime. So primes can be expressed as n² + p when n=0, since p is prime. So primes can always be expressed in that way. So primes can be written as 0² + p. So primes can be written as such. So primes are okay. So the problem is with composite numbers. Wait, but maybe some composite numbers can't be written as n² + p.\n\nWait, the question is whether there are infinitely many positive integers that cannot be expressed in the form n² + p. So primes can be expressed as such, and some composites can, some can't. The question is if there are infinitely many such composites.\n\nSo let's check some numbers. Let's list numbers from 2 upwards and see.\n\n2: Can it be written as n² + p? Let's see. n=0: p=2. But 2 is prime, so n=0, p=2: 0 +2=2. But 0 is not a prime. Wait, the problem states that n is a nonnegative integer, and p is a prime. So n=0 is allowed, but 0 is not prime. So 0 + p = p. So if we use n=0, then the expression is p. So primes can be written as n² + p when n=0. So 2 can be written as 0² +2. But 2 is prime, so that's okay. Wait, but the problem is to express numbers that can't be written as n² + p. So primes can be written as n² + p when n=0, so primes are okay. So primes are okay. Then, for composite numbers, can they all be written as n² + p for some n and prime p?\n\nWait, let's check 4. 4 can be written as 1² +3 (p=3). 3 is prime. So 4 is okay. 6: 1² +5=6, 5 is prime. 8: Let's see, 1² +7=8, 7 is prime. 10: 1² +9=10, but 9 is not prime. Wait, 10 can be written as 3² +1=10, but 1 is not prime. Alternatively, 2² +6=10, but 6 is composite. Wait, 2² + 7=11, which is prime. Wait, maybe 3² +1=10. 1 is not prime. Hmm, so 10: Is there a prime p such that 10 - p is a perfect square?\n\nLet's check possible primes p where 10 - p is a square.\n\nPossible squares up to 10: 0,1,4,9.\n\nSo 10 - p must be 0,1,4,9.\n\nSo p = 10 - 0=10 (not prime), 10 -1=9 (not prime), 10 -4=6 (not prime), 10 -9=1 (not prime). So none of these. So 10 cannot be written as n² + p where p is prime. So 10 is a candidate. Wait, but 10 is even. Let's check other primes.\n\nWait, maybe n=2: 2² + p=4 + p=10 → p=6 (not prime). n=3: 9 + p=10 → p=1 (not prime). n=1: 1 + p=10 → p=9 (not prime). So 10 cannot be written as n² + p. So 10 is one such number. Let's check 12.\n\n12: n=0: p=12 (not prime). n=1: 1 + p=12 → p=11 (prime). So 1 +11=12. So 12 can be written as 1² +11. So 12 is okay.\n\n14: Let's see. n=0: p=14 (not prime). n=1: 1 +13=14 (13 is prime). So 1 +13=14. So 14 is okay.\n\n16: n=0: p=16 (not prime). n=2: 4 + p=16 → p=12 (not prime). n=3: 9 + p=16 → p=7 (prime). So 3² +7=16. So 16 is okay.\n\n18: n=0: p=18 (not prime). n=1: 1 +17=18 (17 is prime). So 18 is okay.\n\n20: n=0: p=20 (not prime). n=2: 4 +16=20 (16 not prime). n=3: 9 +11=20 (11 is prime). So 3² +11=20. So okay.\n\n22: Let's check. n=0: p=22 (nope). n=1: 1 +21=22 (21 not prime). n=2: 4 +18=22 (18 no). n=3: 9 +13=22 (13 is prime). So 3² +13=22. So okay.\n\n24: n=0: p=24 (nope). n=2: 4 +20=24 (20 no). n=3: 9 +15=24 (15 no). n=4: 16 +8=24 (8 no). n=5: 25 + (-1)=24 (invalid). So 24: Are there any primes p where 24 - p is a perfect square?\n\nCheck possible p:\n\n24 -0=24 (not square)\n24 -1=23 (no)\n24 -2=22 (no)\n24 -3=21 (no)\n24 -5=19 (no)\n24 -7=17 (no)\n24 -11=13 (no)\n24 -13=11 (no)\n24 -17=7 (no)\n24 -19=5 (no)\n24 -23=1 (no)\n24 -29=5 (wait, 29 is prime, but 29 >24. So no squares.\n\nSo 24 cannot be written as n² + p. So 24 is another candidate.\n\nHmm, so so far, 2, 10, 24 seem to be candidates. Let's check 30.\n\n30: n=0: p=30 (no). n=1:1 +29=30 (29 prime). So 30 is okay.\n\n32: n=0: p=32 (no). n=1:1 +31=32 (prime). So 32 is okay.\n\n34: n=0:34 (no). n=1:1 +33=34 (no). n=3:9 +25=34 (25 no). n=4:16 +18=34 (18 no). n=5:25 +9=34 (prime). So 5² +9=34, but 9 is not prime. Wait, 34 -9=25, which is 5². So p=9, but 9 is not prime. Wait, so maybe another n. Let's check n=2: 4 +30=34. 30 is composite. n=6: 36 + (-2)=34 (invalid). So 34: Can we write 34 as n² + p where p is prime?\n\nCheck possible squares:\n\n34 -0=34 (no)\n34 -1=33 (no)\n34 -2=32 (no)\n34 -3=31 (prime). So 34=1² +31. So 34 is okay.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let's check 34 again. If n=1: 1² +31=32. No. n=2: 4 +30=34. 30 is composite. n=3: 9 +25=34. 25 is 5², but 25 is not prime. n=5:25 +9=34. 9 is not prime. n=6:36 -2=34 (invalid). So 34 can be written as 1² +31, which is prime. So 34 is okay.\n\nHmm, so maybe 24 is the first candidate. Let's check 36.\n\n36: n=0:36 (no). n=1:1 +35=36 (no). n=3:9 +27=36 (no). n=4:16 +20=36 (no). n=5:25 +11=36 (11 is prime). So 5² +11=36. So 36 is okay.\n\nSo 24 is a candidate. Let's check 40.\n\n40: n=0:40 (no). n=2:4 +36=40 (no). n=3:9 +31=40 (31 prime). So 3² +31=40. So okay.\n\n42: n=0:42 (no). n=3:9 +33=42 (no). n=4:16 +26=42 (no). n=5:25 +17=42 (17 prime). So 5² +17=42. So okay.\n\n44: n=0:44 (no). n=2:4 +42=44", "answer": "Udowodnimy, że dla dowolnej nieparzystej liczby \\(a \\geq 3\\) liczby \\(\\left(\\frac{3a+1}{2}\\right)^2\\) nie można przedstawić w żądanej postaci.

So, we have a circle with a finite number of chords, and a closed loop made of at least three different chords is called a cycle. The definition of a cycle is that it's made of the same set of chords. The problem states that there's a cycle C with 2022 chords, and every other cycle has at least one chord in common with C. We need to find the maximum possible number of cycles there can be.\n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand the definitions correctly. A cycle is a closed loop made of different chords, and two cycles are considered the same if they use the exact same set of chords. So, the cycles are equivalence classes of closed loops with the same chords, regardless of the order or traversal.\n\nGiven that cycle C has 2022 chords, and every other cycle shares at least one chord with C. The question is about maximizing the number of such cycles. Hmm. So, we need to arrange chords in such a way that each new cycle shares at least one chord with C, but we want as many different cycles as possible. But since each cycle is determined by its set of chords, we need to find how many distinct sets of chords can exist such that each set intersects with C in at least one chord.\n\nWait, but the chords are part of a circle. So, the chords are chords of the circle, right? Since it's a circle, all chords are parts of the circumference. So, the chords can be of different lengths, as long as they are chords of the circle. But in this problem, we're given that cycle C has 2022 chords, so C must be a closed loop made of 2022 chords, each a different chord, and the chords are all part of the circle.\n\nNow, the key property is that every other cycle shares at least one chord with C. So, any cycle that's not C must have at least one chord in common with C. Therefore, the cycles can be divided into two categories: those that are exactly C (which we want to maximize the count of), and those that share at least one chord with C. But the problem allows any number of cycles, as long as each cycle shares at least one chord with C. However, since cycles are equivalence classes (same set of chords), the total number of cycles is the number of distinct sets of chords that can be formed, each of which intersects C in at least one chord.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"there exists a cycle C with 2022 chords, such that every other cycle has at least one chord in common with C\". So, the remaining cycles can be any cycles that intersect C in at least one chord. So, the problem is to find the maximum number of such cycles, given that C has 2022 chords. So, we need to maximize the number of cycles (distinct sets of chords) that intersect C in at least one chord.\n\nEach cycle can be represented as a set of chords. Since cycles are equivalence classes, the number of cycles is the number of distinct sets of chords (up to rotation and reflection, since cycles are considered the same if they consist of the same set of chords). But actually, the problem says \"cycles are considered the same if they consist of the same set of chords.\" So, different rotations and reflections are considered distinct cycles only if the chords are the same. Wait, no. Wait, a cycle is a closed loop made of different chords. But if you rotate the cycle, it's the same set of chords, so it's considered the same cycle. Similarly, if you reflect it, it's the same set of chords, so reflection doesn't count as a different cycle. Therefore, cycles are equivalence classes under rotation and reflection. But the problem says \"cycles are considered the same if they consist of the same set of chords\". So, different cycles are different if their chords are different. Even if you rotate or reflect, the chords are the same, so they are considered the same cycle. Therefore, the number of cycles is the number of distinct sets of chords that can form a closed loop.\n\nSo, given that cycle C has 2022 chords, and every other cycle shares at least one chord with C. So, each other cycle must intersect C in at least one chord. Therefore, the problem reduces to: find the maximum number of distinct sets of chords (cycles) such that each set intersects C in at least one chord. Each set is a cycle, meaning it's a closed loop of different chords. The chords are part of the original circle, so the chords are chords of the original circle.\n\nBut how do we model this? Let's think in terms of graph theory. Each chord can be thought of as an edge in a graph. The circle with chords forms a graph where the vertices are the points on the circle, and edges are the chords. So, the circle with chords is a planar graph, right? Because all the chords are chords of the circle, so the graph is planar. But cycles here are closed loops of different chords, which in graph terms would be cycles in the graph. However, in graph theory, a cycle is a closed path with no repeated vertices. But here, the problem allows cycles with different chords, but the same set of chords. So, in graph terms, each cycle is a set of edges (chords) that form a closed loop.\n\nWait, but in graph theory, cycles are defined as closed paths with distinct vertices. However, in this problem, the cycle is defined as a closed loop made of different chords. So, the chords are the edges, and the cycle is a closed walk that uses different edges. So, in graph terms, the cycles would be the edge cycles. So, this is similar to the concept of a cycle space in graph theory, where a cycle space is the set of all cycles (closed walks where edges are distinct). But in this problem, the cycles are equivalence classes of such walks, where two walks are equivalent if they use the same set of edges.\n\nBut perhaps we can model this as a graph where the vertices are the chords, and edges connect chords that share a vertex (i.e., chords that are adjacent to the same vertex on the circle). Then, a cycle in this graph would correspond to a set of chords that form a cycle, i.e., a closed loop where each consecutive pair of chords shares a vertex. But in this case, the problem states that a cycle is a closed loop made of chords, and two cycles are the same if they are the same set of chords. So, it's more like the cycles in the original chord graph. However, the original chord graph is a 1-skeleton of the circle, with vertices at the circle's points and edges as chords.\n\nBut maybe this is complicating things. Let's think differently. Each cycle is a set of chords that form a closed loop. Since the circle is symmetric, cycles can be rotated or reflected. So, the number of distinct cycles is equal to the number of distinct sets of chords that can form such a loop. Now, the key constraint is that every other cycle must share at least one chord with C. So, the maximum number of cycles is the total number of distinct sets of chords (cycles) that intersect C in at least one chord.\n\nBut how do we count this? The total number of distinct sets of chords in the circle is 2^2022, since each chord can be either present or not. But of course, not all subsets form a cycle. A cycle is a closed loop. So, the number of cycles is less than 2^2022. However, the problem is to find the maximum possible number of cycles given that each cycle intersects C in at least one chord. So, we need to find the maximum number of cycles such that every cycle intersects C in at least one chord.\n\nBut how are the cycles structured? Each cycle is a closed loop of chords. So, each cycle must have at least 3 chords (since a cycle must have at least three chords to form a closed loop). But in our case, cycle C has 2022 chords, so it's a very large cycle.\n\nWait, but a cycle is a closed loop. So, in graph theory terms, it's a cycle in the graph where vertices are the points on the circle and edges are the chords. Therefore, each cycle is a closed walk that starts and ends at the same vertex, with no repeated vertices (since it's a cycle). Wait, but actually, in graph theory, a cycle is a closed walk where consecutive vertices are distinct. So, in this context, a cycle is a closed walk with distinct vertices. Therefore, the cycle C has 2022 distinct vertices (points on the circle), each connected by chords, forming a closed loop.\n\nBut how does this relate to the number of cycles? Each cycle is a set of chords that form such a closed loop. So, the number of cycles is equal to the number of distinct edge sets that form a closed loop. However, in our problem, we need to find the maximum number of such cycles, given that each cycle shares at least one chord with C.\n\nSo, maybe the problem is similar to a hypergraph where each hyperedge is a cycle, and we need to find the maximum number of hyperedges such that each hyperedge intersects C in at least one vertex (chord). But since cycles are closed walks, maybe this is equivalent to the cycles in a graph that must intersect C in at least one vertex.\n\nBut in graph terms, if we have a graph G and a subset C of vertices, the number of cycles in G that intersect C is equal to the number of cycles in G that contain at least one vertex from C. So, the question is, given a graph G and a subset C, what's the maximum number of cycles such that every cycle in G intersects C in at least one vertex.\n\nBut in our case, the graph is the circle with all possible chords. But actually, the graph is the original circle's chord graph, which is a complete graph on 2022 points (vertices), but edges are only the chords (simplifying, since all chords are present). Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the number of vertices. Wait, the circle is divided into points where chords are drawn. But the problem states that cycle C has 2022 chords. Since a chord is a line connecting two points on the circle, the number of chords is C(n,2) where n is the number of points on the circle. But cycle C has 2022 chords, so n must satisfy C(n,2) >= 2022. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify how many points are on the circle. Wait, hold on. Maybe the circle is divided into a finite number of points, and all chords between these points are drawn. Then, a cycle is a closed loop of chords that use different chords, forming a closed loop. So, the number of chords in cycle C is 2022, so the number of points on the circle is n where C(n,2) >= 2022. Wait, but the problem states that cycle C has 2022 chords, so the number of points on the circle is n such that C(n,2) is at least 2022. Wait, but actually, if the circle is divided into m points, then the number of chords is C(m,2). But cycle C has 2022 chords, so m(m-1)/2 = 2022. Solving for m: m(m-1) = 4044. Approximate m^2 ≈ 4044, so m ≈ sqrt(4044) ≈ 63.6. So, m=64. Then, C(64,2)=2016, which is less than 2022. So, maybe the circle is divided into more points. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the circle is divided into an even number of points, and the chords are connecting every other point? Wait, but the problem says \"a circle with a finite number of chords\", so it's any circle with a finite number of chords, not necessarily a regular polygon.\n\nBut the key is that cycle C has 2022 chords. So, the circle must have at least 2022 points, since each chord connects two points. So, the minimal number of points is 2023 (since C(n,2) ≥ 2022 implies n ≥ 64, as 63*62/2=1953 < 2022, 64*63/2=2016 < 2022, 65*64/2=2080 ≥ 2022). So, the circle has at least 65 points, and cycle C uses 2022 chords. So, the number of points is at least 65. However, the problem doesn't specify the exact number of points, only that cycle C has 2022 chords. Therefore, maybe the number of points is not fixed, but we need to find the maximum number of cycles such that each cycle intersects C in at least one chord, regardless of the number of points. Wait, but the problem is asking for the maximum number of cycles possible, given that cycle C has 2022 chords, and every other cycle shares at least one chord with C. So, perhaps the number of points is fixed? But the problem doesn't specify. Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem says \"a finite number of chords\", so the circle is divided into a finite number of points, and all chords between these points are present. Then, a cycle is a closed loop of different chords. So, the number of cycles is equal to the number of distinct edge sets that form a closed loop. But the problem states that every other cycle shares at least one chord with C. So, the maximum number of cycles is the number of distinct edge sets that form a closed loop, each intersecting C in at least one chord.\n\nSo, given that cycle C has 2022 chords, the rest of the cycles must each intersect C in at least one chord. So, how do we maximize the number of such cycles?\n\nFirst, note that each cycle must have at least three chords (since it's a closed loop, you need at least three chords to form a triangle, but actually, even with two chords, you can have a cycle, but in a circle, two chords would form a digon, but in the problem, cycles are closed loops made of different chords. Wait, the problem says \"a cycle made of different chords\". So, each cycle is a closed loop with different chords, but can it have two chords? If you have two chords that form a closed loop, like a digon, then it's just two chords connecting the same two points. But in that case, a digon is a cycle of two chords. But in the problem statement, is a cycle allowed to have two chords? The problem says \"each cycle has at least three different chords\". Wait, \"each cycle has at least three different chords\". Wait, no. Wait, \"a cycle made of different chords\", so each cycle is a closed loop using different chords. So, each cycle is a closed loop where all the chords in the cycle are distinct. So, a cycle must have at least three chords, because with two chords, you can have a cycle only if they form", "answer": "Dla każdego cyklu \\( A \\) będziemy oznaczać przez \\( f(A) \\) zbiór wspólnych cięciw cykli \\( A \\) i \\( C \\).

The game is played on a grid of size n x k, starting with a knight in the bottom-left corner. Players take turns moving the knight to adjacent squares (up, down, left, right, and diagonally), and when all knights are on squares adjacent to at least one knight, the game ends. I have to find all n and k where this can't end in a draw, regardless of the starting player's moves.\n\nFirst, let me try to understand the game mechanics. The knight can move in an L-shape each turn. The players alternate turns, so the knight moves first, then the second player, and so on. The game ends when each knight is adjacent to at least one other knight, meaning they can't move anymore. So, the game is a finite impartial game, and according to the Sprague-Grundy theorem, it should be a partizan game, but since the players are taking turns moving the knight, it's actually an impartial game where the available moves are the same for both players. Wait, no, actually, the players are alternately placing knights on neighboring squares, and the moves are determined by the knight's movement. Hmm, maybe it's a variant of the classic impartial game but with different movement rules. \n\nWait, but the players are taking turns moving the knight. Each turn, a player moves the knight from their current position to an adjacent square, and then places a knight there. So the game is played on a grid where each move is a knight's move, and the players take turns moving the knight, with the knights being placed on adjacent squares. The game ends when all knights are adjacent to at least one other, meaning you can't move any further. So, the game is equivalent to a graph where each node is a square on the grid, and edges connect adjacent squares. The game starts with a single knight on a node, and each player takes turns moving the knight along an edge to another node. The game ends when all nodes have at least one knight adjacent to it. Wait, no, because the knights are placed on the squares, but the adjacency is determined by the knight's movement. Hmm, maybe it's better to model this as a graph where each node is a square, and edges connect squares that are adjacent via knight moves. Then, the game is a game where the players alternately move the knight (which is effectively moving from one node to another via knight moves) on this graph. The game ends when there are no available moves from the current knight's position. Wait, but the knights are placed on the squares, but the adjacency is determined by the knight's movement. So, the knights can't be placed on squares that are not adjacent via knight moves. But the game starts with exactly one knight, and players take turns moving the knight to an adjacent square, placing a knight there. Wait, but the problem says: \"We place kropka (a knight) on each square adjacent to at least one square with a knight.\" So, when it says \"on each square adjacent to at least one square with a knight,\" does that mean that after each move, the knight is placed on a square adjacent to at least one knight? Or does it start with one knight and each time, players place a knight on a square adjacent to an existing knight?\n\nWait, let's parse the problem statement again: \"We place kropka (a knight) on each square adjacent to at least one square with a knight.\" So initially, is there one knight on a square, and then every turn, players place a knight on a square adjacent to a knight? Wait, the problem says \"We place kropka (a knight) on each square adjacent to at least one square with a knight.\" So maybe the initial placement is one knight, and then players place knights on squares adjacent to existing knights. Wait, no. The wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"We place kropka (a knight) on each square adjacent to at least one square with a knight.\" So maybe it's a game where the first player places a knight on a square adjacent to the existing one? Wait, no. The problem says \"In the beginning, the k-tth square left is occupied by a knight, and the remaining squares are empty. Then, on each square adjacent to at least one square with a knight, we place a kropka (a knight).\" So the initial state is a knight on one square, and the rest are empty. Then, players take turns placing knights on squares adjacent to an existing knight. Wait, but the game ends when all knights are adjacent to at least one other. Wait, but the problem says \"We place kropka (a knight) on each square adjacent to at least one square with a knight.\" So, initially, there's one knight. Then, each player takes a turn placing a knight on a square adjacent to an existing knight. Once all knights are adjacent to at least one other knight, the game ends. So the game starts with 1 knight, and players alternate placing knights on squares adjacent to existing knights. The game ends when all knights are adjacent to at least one other. So, the game is a variant of the classic knight's game but with multiple knights.\n\nBut the problem says \"the game ends when all knights are adjacent to at least one square with a knight.\" So, the adjacency is in terms of the knight's movement. Wait, but knights can move to squares that are not adjacent in the grid. Wait, but the knights are placed on squares adjacent to existing knights. So, each time a knight is placed, it's adjacent (in the knight's movement sense) to an existing knight. So, the knights form a connected component where each new knight is adjacent to at least one existing knight. The game ends when the entire grid is filled with knights in such a way that no new knight can be placed (i.e., every square has a knight adjacent to it). So, the game is equivalent to a connected graph where each new node is connected to at least one existing node, and the game ends when the graph is a connected component that covers the entire grid.\n\nWait, but in the standard knight's graph, the graph is such that two squares are adjacent if a knight can move between them. But in this case, the adjacency is defined as being adjacent via a knight's move. So, in the standard knight's graph, two squares are adjacent if they are a knight's move apart. But here, adjacency is defined as being adjacent via a knight's move, so the graph is actually the same as the knight's graph. Because a knight can move to a square adjacent via movement in the knight's graph. Wait, actually, in the knight's graph, adjacency is defined as squares that a knight can move between. So, if two squares are a knight's move apart, they are adjacent in the knight's graph. Therefore, in this problem, the adjacency is exactly the knight's graph. Therefore, the game is equivalent to a game played on the knight's graph, where the players take turns moving a token (the knight) along edges, and the game ends when the token has been placed on every vertex in a connected component. Wait, but in this case, the game starts with a single node (the initial knight), and each move consists of moving the knight along an edge to an adjacent node (square). The game ends when all nodes are adjacent to at least one node in the set of placed knights. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"We place kropka (a knight) on each square adjacent to at least one square with a knight.\" So, initially, there is one knight on a square, and then each player places a knight on a square adjacent to an existing knight. The game ends when all knights are adjacent to at least one other knight. So, it's similar to building a connected graph where each new node is adjacent to at least one existing node. The game ends when the entire graph is connected. In graph theory terms, this is called the \"vertex cover\" game, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's similar to the game of building a connected graph by adding vertices connected to the existing graph, and the game ends when the graph is connected. \n\nWait, in this problem, the game is played on a graph where vertices are the squares of the grid, and edges exist between squares that are a knight's move apart. The game starts with one vertex (the initial knight), and players take turns adding vertices to the graph, such that each new vertex is adjacent to at least one existing vertex. The game ends when the graph is connected, i.e., every vertex is reachable from every other vertex via adjacent vertices. So, the question is asking for pairs (n, k) where this game cannot be a draw, regardless of the players' strategies. That is, for any starting player, the game will end, and the last player to place a knight wins. So, we need to find all (n, k) where the game is always a first-player win, second-player win, or third-player win, etc., but not a draw. Wait, but the problem says \"Doesn't end in a draw\", so regardless of who starts, the game can't end in a draw. So for all pairs (n, k), the game is either a first-player win or a second-player win, but not a draw. Therefore, we need to find all (n, k) where the game is always decided by the first player, or always by the second player, but not a draw.\n\nBut I need to confirm: does a draw occur when the game cannot end? That is, if both players continue to place knights, never reaching a connected graph, which would mean the game is infinite. But in the problem statement, it says \"the game ends when all knights are adjacent to at least one square with a knight\". So, if the game never becomes connected, that would be an infinite game, but the problem says \"Doesn't end in a draw\", meaning that the game cannot end in a draw, so for all (n, k), the game must either end in a win for the first player or a win for the second player, but never a draw. So, we need to find all (n, k) where the game is never a draw, i.e., for any starting player, the game will terminate in a win for one of the players.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding all (n, k) where the game on the knight graph of an n x k grid is such that the first player has a winning strategy, or the second player, but not a draw. So, we need to determine for which grid sizes this game is not a draw.\n\nFirst, let's think about small grids.\n\nCase 1: n = 1, k = 1. The grid is a single square. The knight is already placed there. Since there are no adjacent squares, the game ends immediately. So this is a win for the first player, but since there's only one knight, it's already a win for whoever placed it. Wait, but the problem says \"the game ends when all knights are adjacent to at least one square with a knight\". If there's only one knight on a 1x1 grid, then the game ends immediately, so the first player can place the knight, and the game ends. So this is a win for the first player. But since it's already done, perhaps this is trivial. But the problem says \"Doesn't end in a draw\". So, if n=1, k=1, the game ends immediately, so it's not a draw. So (1,1) is a winning position for the first player, not a draw.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"Doesn't end in a draw\". So, if the game cannot end in a draw, then for (1,1), since the game ends immediately, it's not a draw, so (1,1) is a valid pair. But maybe the problem is considering that the game can end in a draw only if there are no moves left. Wait, but if the game ends when all knights are adjacent to at least one other, then in the case of (1,1), the game ends immediately. So, the game cannot be a draw because it's already over. So, (1,1) is a win for whoever places the knight. But the game started with one knight, so that knight is already placed, and the game ends. So, the first player can place the knight, and the game ends. So, in this case, the first player wins. Therefore, (1,1) is a winning position, not a draw.\n\nBut let's check another case. Suppose n=1, k=2. The grid is 1x2. The knight is placed on one square. The other square is adjacent to the first, so the game ends immediately. So, the first player places the knight, and the game ends. So, again, the first player wins. So (1,2) is a win for the first player.\n\nCase 2: n=2, k=2. The grid is 2x2. The knight is placed on one square. The other squares are adjacent via knight moves. Wait, in a 2x2 grid, each square is adjacent to how many others? Let's visualize:\n\nA B\n\nC D\n\nA is adjacent to B (right) and C (down-right).\n\nB is adjacent to A (left), C (down-right), and D (down).\n\nC is adjacent to A (up-left), B (left), and D (down).\n\nD is adjacent to B (up-right), C (up-right), and C (left).\n\nSo, starting with a knight on, say, A. The adjacent squares via knight moves are B and C. So the first player can move to B or C. Suppose they move to B. Then the knight is on B. The remaining squares are A (already occupied), C, D. The adjacent squares to B are A (already there), C (down-right), D (down). So, the second player can move to C or D. Suppose they move to C. Then the knight is on C. Now, the squares already occupied are A, B, C. The remaining square is D. D is adjacent to C (down-right) and B (up-right). So the last player can move to D. So, the game ends with all knights adjacent to each other. So, the first player placed on A, second on B, third on C, and fourth on D. Wait, but in this case, the game ends when all knights are adjacent, which would occur when D is placed. So, the fourth move is the last one. But in reality, the players take turns placing the knight. Wait, in the problem statement, after the initial placement, players take turns placing knights on squares adjacent to existing ones. So, the initial placement is one knight. Then, each player places a knight on a square adjacent to an existing one. The game ends when all knights are adjacent to at least one existing knight. So, in the 2x2 grid, starting with one knight, the first player can move to B or C. Suppose they move to B. Then, the second player can move to C. Then, the first player can move to D. At this point, all knights (A, B, C, D) are adjacent? Wait, after moving to C, D is adjacent to C (down-right) and B (up-right).", "answer": "Takie pary \\((n, k)\\), że \\(n + 1\\) nie jest potęgą dwójki o wykładniku całkowitym dodatnim oraz \\(k\\) jest dowolną liczbą ze zbioru \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}\\).\n\nZauważmy, że po każdej turze wszystkie kamienie znajdują się na polach tej samej parzystości i parzystość ta zmienia się po każdej turze.

And she wants to cover all the faces with triangular net paper pieces. Each triangle is an equilateral triangle with side length 2. The question is asking for all positive integers n where she can do this. The cube has edges of length n, so each face of the cube is a square with side length n. \n\nFirst, I need to visualize how the triangular net pieces can be arranged on the cube. Since each net piece is an equilateral triangle with side length 2, each triangle has three sides of length 2. But the cube has square faces, so the triangles need to fit into the squares somehow. Maybe the triangles are arranged so that their sides align with the edges of the cube?\n\nWait, but an equilateral triangle can't fit exactly into a square. The angles don't match. Hmm, this seems tricky. Maybe the triangles are being placed in a way that their sides are along the edges of the cube? Let me think. If each triangle has a side length of 2, and the cube's edges are length n, then perhaps each triangle is placed such that its sides are aligned with the cube's edges, but the triangles are folded in such a way that their corners touch the edges of the cube. \n\nBut how exactly? Let me break it down. Each face of the cube is a square. To cover it with triangles, maybe we need to place the triangles such that their edges align with the cube's edges. But since the triangles are equilateral, their sides are all equal. If the cube's edge is n, then each triangle's side length is 2, so n must be at least 2 to fit the triangles. Wait, but the problem says \"the cube has edges of length n\" and \"n² triangles each of side length 2\". So n is the edge length of the cube, and there are n² triangles. So the cube's edge n must be at least 2, right? But maybe n can be larger. \n\nBut the key is to determine for which positive integers n this is possible. So the question is about the possible values of n where such a tiling is possible. Let me try to think of examples. \n\nFirst, consider the case when n=1. Then the cube has edge length 1, and there is 1 triangle. But a cube's face is a 1x1 square. A single equilateral triangle of side length 2 can't fit into a 1x1 square. So n=1 is impossible. Similarly, n=2: the cube has edge length 2, and there are 4 triangles. Each triangle has area (√3/4)*2² = √3. The area of the cube's face is 2x2=4, so total area needed is 4 triangles * √3 ≈ 6.928, which is more than 4. So even if the areas match, the arrangement might not be possible. Wait, but maybe the triangles can be arranged in a way that they cover multiple faces? Wait, no. The problem says \"each point on the cube's surface is covered by at least one triangle\". So all six faces must be covered. Therefore, the sum of the areas of the triangles must be equal to the total surface area of the cube. \n\nWait, but the cube's surface area is 6*(n²). Each triangle has area (√3/4)*(2²) = √3. So total area of the triangles needed is 4n²*(√3). Therefore, 4n²*(√3) = 6n². Simplifying, 4√3 = 6, which is not true. So that's impossible. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, maybe my calculation is wrong. Let me check. \n\nEach triangle has side length 2, so area is (√3/4)*2² = √3. There are 4n² such triangles. So total area is 4n²*√3. But the cube's surface area is 6n². So 4n²√3 = 6n² => 4√3 = 6 => √3 = 1.5. Which is not true. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. So if the areas don't match, it's impossible? But the problem says \"each point on the cube's surface is covered by at least one triangle\". So maybe the triangles can overlap on the cube's surface? But the problem states \"each point on the cube's surface is covered by at least one triangle\". So overlapping would still count as covering the point. But in that case, the total area would have to be at least the cube's surface area. But according to the earlier calculation, the total area of the triangles is 4n²√3, and the cube's surface area is 6n². So 4√3 = 6, which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that it's impossible for any n? But that can't be, since the problem asks for all positive integers n where this is possible. So maybe my area calculation is wrong. Wait, no. The triangles are placed on the cube's surface, so they are all lying on the faces of the cube. Each triangle is an equilateral triangle, but it's placed on a square face. Therefore, the triangles are folded or arranged such that their edges align with the square's edges. Wait, but how can an equilateral triangle fit into a square?\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe the triangles are not placed on the cube's faces but are arranged in 3D space? Wait, no, the problem says \"each point on the cube's surface is covered by at least one triangle\". So the triangles are placed on the cube's surfaces, but since the cubes have square faces, the triangles must be arranged such that their edges align with the cube's edges. \n\nWait, perhaps the triangles are arranged in a way that their sides are along the cube's edges. For example, each triangle is placed such that two of its vertices are on adjacent edges of the cube, and the third vertex is a corner of the cube. But since the triangle is equilateral, the distance between the vertices should be 2. But in a cube, the edges are length n, and the face diagonals are n√2. So if we have an equilateral triangle with side length 2, then the edges of the cube must be at least 2. But the cube's edges are n, so n must be at least 2. However, the triangles need to be arranged such that their sides are 2 and their vertices are on the cube's edges. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the triangles are arranged in a way that they form a sort of star pattern on each face of the cube. For example, each face of the cube has a central triangle, with four surrounding triangles, each sharing an edge with the central one. But since the triangles are equilateral, this would require that the central triangle and the surrounding four are all in the same plane, but the cube's faces are squares. So this seems impossible because the surrounding triangles would have to be placed on the square's edges, but an equilateral triangle can't fit into a square. \n\nWait, perhaps the triangles are arranged in 3D. For example, each face of the cube has a triangle that is folded upwards into the cube. But the problem states that the triangles are in the shape of a cube, so they must lie on the surface of the cube. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to think of a specific example. Let's take n=2. The cube has edge length 2, so each face is 2x2. There are 4 triangles. Each triangle has area √3. Total area needed is 4√3 ≈ 6.928. The cube's surface area is 6*(2)^2 = 24. So 6.928 is less than 24, so in theory, it's possible if the triangles can overlap and cover the cube's surface. But the problem says \"each point on the cube's surface is covered by at least one triangle\". So overlapping is allowed, but the total area covered must be at least 24? Wait, no. The problem doesn't state that the triangles must cover the entire cube's surface with no gaps, just that every point is covered by at least one triangle. So overlapping is allowed, but the total area covered could be larger. However, in this case, the total area of the triangles is 4√3 ≈ 6.928, which is much less than 24. So how can the triangles cover the cube's surface? Unless some triangles cover the same area multiple times, but the problem doesn't restrict that. Wait, but the problem says \"each point on the cube's surface is covered by at least one triangle\". So even if some areas are covered multiple times, as long as every point is covered by at least one triangle, it's okay. So maybe the total area can be larger than the cube's surface area. For example, overlapping triangles can cover the same point multiple times, but each point must be covered at least once. So perhaps the key is that the union of all triangles must cover the entire cube's surface. \n\nBut in that case, the union of the triangles must have an area (but not necessarily equal to) the cube's surface area. However, the sum of the areas of the triangles is 4n²√3, and the cube's surface area is 6n². So if 4n²√3 is less than 6n², which simplifies to 4√3 < 6, which is true (since √3 ≈ 1.732, so 4*1.732 ≈ 6.928 < 6*1 = 6? Wait, no. Wait 4√3 ≈ 6.928, and 6n² is 6n². So 6.928 < 6n² would require n² > 1.154, which is true for n >=2. But in the case of n=2, 6n²=24, and 4√3≈6.928 <24. So in that case, the total area of the triangles is less than the cube's surface area. So how can they cover the cube's surface? Unless the triangles are arranged in such a way that their union covers the entire surface, even if they overlap. \n\nBut in that case, the problem is not about the area but about covering the surface. So maybe the triangles are arranged in a way that their union is the entire cube's surface. For example, imagine a cube with each face divided into smaller regions, and triangles placed on those regions such that each face is covered by at least one triangle. \n\nBut how does this relate to the triangles being equilateral with side length 2? The triangles have to be placed on the cube's surfaces, which are squares. So maybe each triangle is placed on a square face such that two of its vertices are on adjacent edges of the square, and the third vertex is a corner of the square. Wait, but an equilateral triangle with side length 2 would have all sides equal, so if two vertices are on adjacent edges of a square, the distance between them would be 2, but the diagonal of the square is n√2. So unless n is large enough, this might not work. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the triangles are arranged in a 3D way. For example, each triangle is placed on a face of the cube, but the triangle is folded upwards into the cube. However, the problem says \"each point on the cube's surface is covered by at least one triangle\". If the triangles are folded into the cube, then their other faces are internal, so they don't cover the external surface. Therefore, triangles must be placed on the external faces. \n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe I need to think of a specific tiling. Let's take n=2. The cube has edge length 2, so each face is 2x2. There are 4 triangles. Each triangle has area √3. So the total area is 4√3. The cube's surface area is 24. So even if the triangles are arranged in a way that their union is the entire cube's surface, they would need to cover 24 units of area, but their total area is only 4√3 ≈ 6.928. That seems impossible unless the triangles overlap a lot. But the problem allows overlapping, but each point must be covered by at least one triangle. So even if they overlap, the union of the triangles must cover the entire cube's surface. \n\nWait, but how can 4√3 (≈6.928) units of area cover 24 units? Unless the triangles are arranged in a way that each triangle covers a portion of the cube's surface, but their total coverage must be 24. But if the triangles are placed on the cube's faces, each triangle can cover at most 4 units of area (the entire face). But each triangle is an equilateral triangle with side length 2, so its area is √3 ≈ 1.732. So each triangle can cover up to 4 units of area on its face. But if the cube's face is 2x2, then the triangle is placed on the face. Wait, but if the triangle is placed on the face of the cube, its area is √3. So each triangle can cover √3 ≈1.732 units of area on its face. Therefore, the total coverage would be 4n²√3. But the cube's surface area is 6n². So 4n²√3 >= 6n² => 4√3 >=6 => √3 >=1.5. Which is true. So in theory, it's possible if the triangles can be arranged such that their overlapping regions cover the entire cube's surface. \n\nBut how does this work? For example, if each triangle is placed on a face of the cube, overlapping with others. But each triangle has an area of approximately 1.732, and there are 4n² triangles. So the total coverage would be 4n²√3. But the cube's surface area is 6n². So even if there's full overlap, the total coverage must be at least 6n². But since 4√3 ≈6.928, which is greater than 6, so even if there's full overlap, the total coverage would be 4n²√3, which is greater than 6n² for all n. Wait, but 4√3 ≈6.928, which is greater than 6. So 4n²√3 >=6n² for any n >=1. Therefore, if the triangles can be arranged such that their union covers the entire cube's surface, even if there is full overlap, it's possible. So maybe for all n >=1, it's possible? But the problem is asking for all positive integers n where this is possible. But maybe there's a catch. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"each point on the cube's surface is covered by at least one triangle\". So even if two triangles overlap on a point, it's", "answer": "Jadzia może okleić kostkę zgodnie z warunkami zadania dla wszystkich dodatnich liczb całkowitych \\( n \\).  \n\nW rozwiązaniu wykorzystamy następujące obserwacje: jeśli \\( m \\) jest liczbą naturalną i \\( a > 0 \\), to trójkąt równoboczny o boku \\( m \\cdot a \\) można podzielić na \\( m^2 \\) trójkątów równobocznych o boku \\( a \\).

So, we have a quadratic function f, and three distinct real numbers x, y, z such that f(x) = yz, f(y) = zx, and f(z) = xy. We need to express f(x + y + z) in terms of x, y, z. Hmm, quadratic functions... So, f is a quadratic equation, which means it has the form f(t) = at² + bt + c, where a, b, c are constants, and a ≠ 0. Since it's quadratic, there are three coefficients we need to determine. But we have three equations involving f(x), f(y), f(z). Let me write those down.\n\nFirst, f(x) = yz. So, substituting into the quadratic equation, we get:\na x² + b x + c = yz. (1)\n\nSimilarly, f(y) = zx:\na y² + b y + c = zx. (2)\n\nAnd f(z) = xy:\na z² + b z + c = xy. (3)\n\nSo we have three equations with three unknowns a, b, c. If we can solve these equations, we can express f(t) in terms of x, y, z, and then substitute t = x + y + z to find f(x + y + z). That should give us the desired expression.\n\nBut solving a system of three equations with three variables might be a bit involved. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to approach this problem without directly solving for a, b, c. Since we need to find f(x + y + z), perhaps we can find some relations between x, y, z first.\n\nLooking at the three equations: equations (1), (2), (3). Let's see if we can subtract some equations to eliminate c. For example, subtract equation (1) from equation (2):\n\na y² + b y + c - (a x² + b x + c) = zx - yz\na(y² - x²) + b(y - x) = z(x - y)\nFactor the left side:\na(y - x)(y + x) + b(y - x) = -z(x - y)\nNotice that (y - x) = -(x - y), so:\na(y + x)(y - x) + b(y - x) = z(x - y)\nFactor out (y - x):\n(y - x)[a(y + x) + b] = z(x - y)\nMultiply both sides by -1 to make it look cleaner:\n(y - x)[a(y + x) + b] = -z(x - y) = z(y - x)\nSo:\n(y - x)[a(y + x) + b] = z(y - x)\nSince x, y, z are distinct, y - x ≠ 0, so we can divide both sides by (y - x):\na(y + x) + b = z\nSimilarly, if we subtract equation (2) from equation (3):\n\na z² + b z + c - (a y² + b y + c) = xy - zx\na(z² - y²) + b(z - y) = x(y - z)\nFactor left side:\na(z - y)(z + y) + b(z - y) = -x(z - y)\nFactor out (z - y):\n(z - y)[a(z + y) + b] = -x(z - y)\nAgain, z - y = -(y - z), so:\n(z - y)[a(z + y) + b] = x(z - y)\nSince z, y are distinct, z - y ≠ 0, so:\n(z - y)[a(z + y) + b] = x(z - y)\nDivide both sides by (z - y):\na(z + y) + b = x\nSimilarly, if we subtract equation (1) from equation (3):\n\na z² + b z + c - (a x² + b x + c) = xy - yz\na(z² - x²) + b(z - x) = y(x - z)\nFactor left side:\na(z - x)(z + x) + b(z - x) = y(z - x)\nFactor out (z - x):\n(z - x)[a(z + x) + b] = y(z - x)\nAgain, z - x = -(x - z), so:\n(z - x)[a(z + x) + b] = -y(z - x)\nDivide both sides by (z - x):\na(z + x) + b = -y\n\nWait, so from the three differences, we get three equations:\n\n1. a(y + x) + b = z (from equations 1 and 2)\n2. a(z + y) + b = x (from equations 2 and 3)\n3. a(z + x) + b = -y (from equations 1 and 3)\n\nHmm, so these three equations relate a, b, and the sums of pairs of variables. Let me write them again:\n\nEquation A: a(x + y) + b = z\n\nEquation B: a(y + z) + b = x\n\nEquation C: a(z + x) + b = -y\n\nNow, we have three equations with variables a, b, and coefficients x, y, z. Let me try to solve this system.\n\nFirst, subtract Equation A from Equation B:\n\n[a(y + z) + b] - [a(x + y) + b] = x - z\n\nSimplify left side:\n\na(y + z - x - y) = a(z - x) = x - z\n\nSo, a(z - x) = x - z = -(z - x)\n\nThus, a(z - x) = -(z - x)\n\nAssuming z ≠ x, which they aren't because z is distinct from x and y, so we can divide both sides by (z - x):\n\na = -1\n\nSo we find that a = -1.\n\nNow, substitute a = -1 into Equation A:\n\n-1*(x + y) + b = z\n\nSo, -x - y + b = z\n\nThus, b = z + x + y\n\nSimilarly, substitute a = -1 into Equation B:\n\n-1*(y + z) + b = x\n\nSo, -y - z + b = x\n\nBut we already have b = x + y + z from Equation A, so substitute that into this equation:\n\n- y - z + (x + y + z) = x\n\nSimplify left side:\n\n(- y - z + x + y + z) = x\n\nWhich simplifies to x = x, which is an identity. So that's consistent.\n\nSimilarly, substitute a = -1 into Equation C:\n\n-1*(z + x) + b = -y\n\nSo, -z - x + b = -y\n\nAgain, substitute b = x + y + z:\n\n- z - x + x + y + z = -y\n\nSimplify left side:\n\n(-z - x + x + y + z) = y\n\nWhich simplifies to y = y, which is also an identity. So, all three equations are consistent when a = -1 and b = x + y + z.\n\nSo, we found that a = -1 and b = x + y + z. Now, we need to find c. Let's use Equation 1:\n\na x² + b x + c = yz\n\nWe know a = -1, b = x + y + z, so substitute:\n\n-1 * x² + (x + y + z) * x + c = yz\n\nSimplify left side:\n\n- x² + x² + x y + x z + c = yz\n\nSimplify:\n\n0 + x y + x z + c = yz\n\nThus, c = yz - x y - x z\n\nFactor y z - x y - x z:\n\n= y z - x(y + z) = y(z - x) - x y\n\nWait, but maybe factor differently:\n\n= y z - x(y + z) = y z - x y - x z\n\nAlternatively, factor y:\n\n= y(z - x) - x z\n\nBut perhaps keep it as c = y z - x y - x z for now.\n\nSo, the quadratic function f(t) is:\n\nf(t) = -t² + (x + y + z) t + (y z - x y - x z)\n\nNow, we need to compute f(x + y + z). Let's denote s = x + y + z for simplicity.\n\nSo, f(s) = -s² + (x + y + z) s + y z - x y - x z\n\nLet me expand this:\n\nFirst, expand the second term:\n\n(x + y + z)s = s² + (x + y + z) s\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, f(s) = -s² + (x + y + z)s + (y z - x y - x z)\n\nSo, substitute s = x + y + z:\n\nf(s) = - (x + y + z)^2 + (x + y + z)(x + y + z) + (y z - x y - x z)\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: - (x + y + z)^2\n\nSecond term: (x + y + z)^2\n\nThird term: (y z - x y - x z)\n\nSo, combining first and second terms:\n\n- (x + y + z)^2 + (x + y + z)^2 = 0\n\nSo, the first two terms cancel out. Then we have:\n\nf(s) = 0 + (y z - x y - x z) = y z - x y - x z\n\nTherefore, f(x + y + z) = y z - x y - x z\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, regardless of the values of x, y, z (as long as they are distinct and satisfy the given conditions), the value of f(x + y + z) is simply y z - x y - x z. Let me check if this makes sense.\n\nLet me verify this result with an example. Suppose we take specific numbers for x, y, z, compute f(x), f(y), f(z), and then check if the result holds.\n\nLet's choose x = 1, y = 2, z = 3.\n\nFirst, compute f(x) = f(1) = y z = 2 * 3 = 6\n\nSimilarly, f(y) = f(2) = z x = 3 * 1 = 3\n\nf(z) = f(3) = x y = 1 * 2 = 2\n\nSo, f(1) = 6, f(2) = 3, f(3) = 2.\n\nNow, let's find the quadratic function f(t) such that f(1) = 6, f(2) = 3, f(3) = 2.\n\nLet's set up the equations:\n\nFor t = 1: a(1)^2 + b(1) + c = 6 → a + b + c = 6\n\nFor t = 2: a(4) + b(2) + c = 3 → 4a + 2b + c = 3\n\nFor t = 3: a(9) + b(3) + c = 2 → 9a + 3b + c = 2\n\nNow, solve this system:\n\nEquation 1: a + b + c = 6\n\nEquation 2: 4a + 2b + c = 3\n\nEquation 3: 9a + 3b + c = 2\n\nSubtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n\n3a + b = -3 (Equation A)\n\nSubtract Equation 2 from Equation 3:\n\n5a + b = -1 (Equation B)\n\nSubtract Equation A from Equation B:\n\n2a = 2 → a = 1\n\nThen, from Equation A: 3(1) + b = -3 → 3 + b = -3 → b = -6\n\nThen, from Equation 1: 1 + (-6) + c = 6 → -5 + c = 6 → c = 11\n\nSo, f(t) = t² - 6t + 11\n\nNow, compute f(x + y + z) where x=1, y=2, z=3. So, x + y + z = 6.\n\nf(6) = 6² - 6*6 + 11 = 36 - 36 + 11 = 11\n\nNow, compute y z - x y - x z = 2*3 -1*2 -1*3 = 6 - 2 - 3 = 1\n\nWait, but according to our previous conclusion, f(x + y + z) should be y z - x y - x z = 1, but f(6) is 11. That contradicts our earlier result. Hmm, so there must be a mistake in our reasoning.\n\nWait, this is a problem. According to our example, with x=1, y=2, z=3, the result f(x + y + z) should be 11, but according to our general formula, it's y z - x y - x z = 1. So, clearly, there's a mistake here.\n\nTherefore, our previous conclusion is wrong. So, where did we go wrong?\n\nLet me retrace the steps. We found a quadratic function f(t) = -t² + (x + y + z) t + (y z - x y - x z). Then, substituting t = s = x + y + z, we get f(s) = y z - x y - x z. But in the example, this does not hold. Therefore, our general formula must be incorrect.\n\nSo, where did we go wrong? Let's check the example step by step.\n\nIn the example, we found a = -1, b = x + y + z, and c = y z - x y - x z.\n\nBut according to this, f(t) = -t² + (x + y + z) t + (y z - x y - x z)\n\nNow, substituting t = x + y + z:\n\nf(x + y + z) = - (x + y + z)^2 + (x + y + z)(x + y + z) + (y z - x y - x z)\n\nSimplify:\n\nFirst term: - (x + y + z)^2\n\nSecond term: (x + y + z)^2\n\nThird term: y z - x y - x z\n\nSo, combining first and second terms: (-1 + 1)(x + y + z)^2 = 0\n\nThird term: y z - x y - x z\n\nThus, f(x + y + z) = y z - x y - x z\n\nBut in the example, when x=1, y=2, z=3:\n\ny z - x y - x z = 2*3 -1*2 -", "answer": "Funkcja \\( f \\) jest dana wzorem \\( f(t) = at^2 + bt + c \\) dla pewnych liczb rzeczywistych \\( a, b, c \\).

The equations are:\n\n1. ab + cd = 6\n2. ac + bd = 3\n3. ad + bc = 2\n4. a + b + c + d = 6\n\nHmm, okay. Let me start by trying to understand what these equations represent. They involve products of variables and sums. Maybe there's a way to combine these equations or find relationships between the variables.\n\nFirst, equation 4 is the sum of all variables. That might be useful later. Let me see if I can express some variables in terms of others. But with four variables, that's a lot of possibilities. Maybe I can look for symmetric solutions or see if some variables are equal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can introduce substitutions. Let me think. Suppose I let S = a + b + c + d = 6. Then, perhaps express some of the other equations in terms of S.\n\nLooking at equation 1: ab + cd = 6. If I can relate this to S, but not sure yet. Equation 2: ac + bd = 3. Equation 3: ad + bc = 2. These are products of pairs of variables. Maybe if I consider variables in pairs.\n\nWait, another idea: Let me consider variables a, b as one pair and c, d as another pair. Then, in equation 1: their product sum is 6. Equation 2: product of a and c plus product of b and d is 3. Equation 3: product of a and d plus product of b and c is 2. Then equation 4: sum of all variables is 6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set variables in pairs. Let me try to set variables as x, y, m, n where x = a + b, y = c + d, m = ac, n = bd, p = ad, q = bc. But this might complicate things. Wait, but maybe not. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, think of variables as two groups: two variables, say a and b, and the other two variables c and d. Then, maybe express equations in terms of these groups.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use substitution. Let me see if I can express variables in terms of others.\n\nLet me try to express variables from equations 1 to 3 and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nFrom equation 1: ab = 6 - cd\n\nFrom equation 2: ac = 3 - bd\n\nFrom equation 3: ad = 2 - bc\n\nHmm. So, I can write each product as the sum minus the other product. Maybe substitute these into equation 4 or into some other equation.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the product terms. Let me see if I can find expressions involving products ab, ac, etc., and maybe use them to find a relation.\n\nAlternatively, consider variables as roots of some polynomial. If I can set up a system where these equations correspond to Vieta's formulas for a quartic equation, but that might be too complex. Let's see.\n\nSuppose that a, b, c, d are roots of a quartic equation x^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s = 0. Then, Vieta's formulas would give:\n\na + b + c + d = -p = 6 ⇒ p = -6\n\nab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd = q\n\nabc + abd + acd + bcd = -r\n\nabcd = s\n\nBut in our equations, we have ab + cd = 6, ac + bd = 3, ad + bc = 2. So, the sum of products of two variables at a time is 6 + 3 + 2 = 11. So q = 11.\n\nThen, abc + abd + acd + bcd = -r. Let's see if we can compute that. Let's factor:\n\nabc + abd + acd + bcd = ab(c + d) + cd(a + b)\n\nFrom equation 1: ab = 6 - cd\n\nFrom equation 4: a + b + c + d = 6 ⇒ (a + b) + (c + d) = 6. Let me denote S1 = a + b and S2 = c + d. Then S1 + S2 = 6.\n\nThen, abc + abd + acd + bcd = ab(c + d) + cd(a + b) = (6 - cd)S2 + cd S1\n\nSo this equals 6 S2 - cd S2 + cd S1 = 6 S2 + cd (S1 - S2)\n\nBut S1 + S2 = 6, so S1 - S2 = 2 S1 - 6\n\nWait, maybe this approach is getting too complicated. Let me hold onto that thought.\n\nAlternatively, maybe try to find relations between the equations.\n\nFor example, if I take equations 1, 2, 3 and 4, perhaps I can manipulate them to find expressions.\n\nLet me write down the four equations again:\n\n1. ab + cd = 6\n\n2. ac + bd = 3\n\n3. ad + bc = 2\n\n4. a + b + c + d = 6\n\nLet me try to multiply all four equations together. Wait, but that might be messy. Alternatively, maybe add or subtract equations.\n\nAlternatively, consider that equations 1, 2, 3 have similar structures. Let me see if there's a pattern here.\n\nSuppose I let x = a + b, y = c + d, z = ac + bd, w = ad + bc. Then, perhaps relate these variables.\n\nBut I need more information. Wait, equation 1 is ab + cd = 6. If x = a + b and y = c + d, then a = (x - b), but maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express variables in terms of x, y, z, w.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider variables as two variables each, a and b, c and d. Then, perhaps set variables as a and b, c and d. Then, equations 1, 2, 3 are products of pairs.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let me consider variables as two separate pairs. Let me set S1 = a + b and S2 = c + d. Then, from equation 4, we have S1 + S2 = 6.\n\nThen, let me consider equations 2 and 3. Equation 2: ac + bd = 3. Equation 3: ad + bc = 2.\n\nHmm. Let me denote:\n\nFrom S1 = a + b and S2 = c + d, then:\n\na = S1 - b\n\nc = S2 - d\n\nThen, substitute into equations 2 and 3.\n\nEquation 2: ac + bd = (S1 - b)(S2 - d) + b d = S1 S2 - S1 d - S2 b + b d + b d = S1 S2 - S1 d - S2 b + 2 b d = 3\n\nBut S1 S2 is a constant term, S1 and S2 are known in terms of a and b?\n\nWait, S1 = a + b, so S1 S2 = (a + b)(c + d). Similarly, S1 d = (a + b) d, and S2 b = (c + d) b.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express this in terms of S1 and S2.\n\nWait, but S1 and S2 are variables here, so this seems a bit stuck.\n\nAlternatively, note that equation 2 is ac + bd = 3, equation 3 is ad + bc = 2.\n\nIf I add equations 2 and 3: ac + bd + ad + bc = 5. Factor this: a(c + d) + b(c + d) = (a + b)(c + d) = S1 S2 = 5.\n\nBut from equation 4, S1 + S2 = 6. So we have:\n\nS1 S2 = 5\n\nS1 + S2 = 6\n\nTherefore, S1 and S2 are roots of the quadratic equation x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0, which factors as (x - 1)(x - 5) = 0. Therefore, S1 and S2 are 1 and 5 in some order.\n\nSo either S1 = 1, S2 = 5 or S1 = 5, S2 = 1.\n\nTherefore, either:\n\nCase 1: a + b = 1 and c + d = 5\n\nCase 2: a + b = 5 and c + d = 1\n\nLet me check both cases.\n\nStarting with Case 1: a + b = 1, c + d = 5\n\nThen, from equation 4, we have S1 = 1, S2 = 5. Then, equation 2: ac + bd = 3\n\nEquation 3: ad + bc = 2\n\nSo, we need to find a, b, c, d such that:\n\na + b = 1\n\nc + d = 5\n\nac + bd = 3\n\nad + bc = 2\n\nAlso, from equation 1: ab + cd = 6\n\nLet me try to express variables in terms of others.\n\nLet me set a = 1 - b, since a + b = 1. Similarly, c = 5 - d.\n\nThen, substitute into equation 2: (1 - b)c + bd = 3\n\nSubstitute c = 5 - d: (1 - b)(5 - d) + bd = 3\n\nExpand: 5 - d - 5b + bd + bd = 3\n\nCombine like terms: 5 - d -5b + 2bd = 3\n\nThen, 2bd - d -5b = 3 -5 ⇒ 2bd - d -5b = -2\n\nSimilarly, equation 3: a d + b c = (1 - b)d + b(5 - d) = 2\n\nExpand: d - bd + 5b - bd = 2\n\nCombine like terms: d - 2bd +5b = 2\n\nSo, now we have two equations:\n\n1. 2bd - d -5b = -2\n\n2. d - 2bd +5b = 2\n\nLet me write them as:\n\nEquation A: 2bd - d -5b = -2\n\nEquation B: -2bd + d +5b = 2\n\nWait, equation B is the same as equation A multiplied by -1:\n\nEquation B: - (2bd - d -5b) = 2 ⇒ -2bd + d +5b = - (-2) ⇒ 2 = 2? Wait, no. Wait:\n\nOriginal equation A: 2bd - d -5b = -2\n\nMultiply equation A by -1: -2bd + d +5b = 2, which is exactly equation B. So equations A and B are the same. Therefore, we have only one equation here, which is redundant.\n\nSo, only one equation from equations 2 and 3. Let's take equation A: 2bd - d -5b = -2\n\nLet me rearrange this equation: 2bd - d -5b +2 = 0\n\nFactor terms with d: d(2b -1) -5b +2 =0\n\nSo, d(2b -1) = 5b -2\n\nThus, d = (5b -2)/(2b -1)\n\nSimilarly, we can write this as d = (5b -2)/(2b -1)\n\nNow, we also have equation 1: ab + cd = 6. Since a = 1 - b, and c =5 - d, equation 1 becomes:\n\n(1 - b)b + (5 - d)d =6\n\nExpand: b - b^2 +5d - d^2 =6\n\nBut since d is expressed in terms of b, let's substitute d = (5b -2)/(2b -1) into this equation.\n\nFirst, compute b - b^2 +5d - d^2 =6\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nb - b^2 +5d - d^2 =6\n\nSubstitute d = (5b -2)/(2b -1):\n\nFirst, compute 5d =5*(5b -2)/(2b -1) = (25b -10)/(2b -1)\n\nCompute d^2 = [(5b -2)/(2b -1)]^2 = (25b^2 -20b +4)/(2b -1)^2\n\nTherefore, equation becomes:\n\nb - b^2 + (25b -10)/(2b -1) - (25b^2 -20b +4)/(2b -1)^2 =6\n\nThis looks complicated, but let's combine terms over a common denominator. Let's denote denominator as (2b -1)^2.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator accordingly:\n\nFirst term: b - b^2 = [b - b^2]*(2b -1)^2 / (2b -1)^2\n\nSecond term: (25b -10)/(2b -1) = [25b -10]*(2b -1) / (2b -1)^2\n\nThird term: -(25b^2 -20b +4)/(2b -1)^2\n\nFourth term: 6 =6*(2b -1)^2 / (2b -1)^2\n\nSo, combining all terms:\n\n[ b - b^2 ]*(2b -1)^2 + (25b -10)*(2b -1) - (25b^2 -20b +4) +6*(2b -1)^2 =0\n\nThis is a quartic equation in b. Let me expand each term step by step.\n\nFirst, expand (2b -1)^2 =4b^2 -4b +1\n\nThen, compute each part:\n\n1.

If a = 0, then from equation (1): 0 + b²c = 0, so b²c = 0. That implies either b = 0 or c = 0.\n\nCase 1: a = 0, b = 0. Then, equation (2) becomes 0 + c²*0 = 0*0, which is 0 = 0, okay. Equation (3) becomes c³ + 0*0 = c*0, so c³ = 0, which gives c = 0. So (0, 0, 0) is a solution.\n\nCase 2: a = 0, c = 0. Then equation (1) is okay (0 + b²*0 = 0). Equation (2) becomes b³ + 0 = b*0 => b³ = 0 => b = 0. So same as case 1.\n\nCase 3: a = 0, and c ≠ 0, b ≠ 0. Wait, but if a = 0 and c ≠ 0, but b ≠ 0, then from equation (1), b²c = 0, but c ≠ 0 and b ≠ 0, which is a contradiction. Similarly, if a = 0 and c = 0, then b must be 0. So no other solutions here.\n\nSimilarly, check if b = 0. If b = 0, equation (2) becomes 0 + c²a = 0 => c²a = 0 => either c = 0 or a = 0. Then, if b = 0 and c = 0, equation (1) becomes a³ = 0 => a = 0. So again (0,0,0). If b = 0 and a = 0, same as before.\n\nSame for c = 0. If c = 0, equation (3) becomes 0 + a²b = 0 => a²b = 0. So either a = 0 or b = 0. If c = 0 and a = 0, then from equation (1), b²*0 = 0 => 0 = 0, but equation (2) would be 0 + 0*a = b*0 => 0 = 0. So similar to before, leading to (0,0,0). If c = 0 and b = 0, same.\n\nSo the only solution with any variable being zero is (0,0,0). Now, check if there are solutions where all variables are non-zero.\n\nLet me suppose that a, b, c are all non-zero. Then, maybe we can manipulate the equations to find some relationships between a, b, c.\n\nLooking at equation (1): a³ + b²c = a c. Let's rearrange this:\n\na³ - a c + b²c = 0\n\nFactor out a from the first two terms:\n\na(a² - c) + b²c = 0\n\nHmm, not sure if helpful. Alternatively, perhaps divide both sides by a (since a ≠ 0):\n\na² + (b²c)/a = c\n\nSimilarly, from equation (2):\n\nb³ + c²a = b a => (b³)/b + (c²a)/b = a => b² + (c²a)/b = a (since c²a/b is (c²)/b * a, but since a ≠ 0, maybe factor a? Wait equation (2) is:\n\nb³ + c²a = b a. Let's rearrange:\n\nb³ - b a + c²a = 0\n\nFactor out b from the first two terms:\n\nb(b² - a) + c²a = 0\n\nSimilarly, divide by b (since b ≠ 0):\n\nb² - a + (c²a)/b = 0\n\nWait, not sure. Maybe another approach. Let's try to express each equation in terms of ratios.\n\nFor example, from equation (1): a³ + b²c = a c => divide both sides by a c (since a ≠ 0, c ≠ 0):\n\n(a²)/(c) + (b²)/(a) = 1\n\nSimilarly, equation (2): b³ + c²a = b a => divide by b a:\n\n(b²)/(a) + (c²)/(b) = 1\n\nEquation (3): c³ + a²b = c b => divide by c b:\n\n(c²)/(b) + (a²)/(c) = 1\n\nSo now, we have:\n\n(1) (a²)/c + (b²)/a = 1\n\n(2) (b²)/a + (c²)/b = 1\n\n(3) (c²)/b + (a²)/c = 1\n\nInteresting, so each equation is the sum of two terms equal to 1, and the terms are cyclic permutations. Let me denote:\n\nLet x = a²/c, y = b²/a, z = c²/b. Then equations become:\n\n(1) x + y = 1\n\n(2) y + z = 1\n\n(3) z + x = 1\n\nSo we have a system:\n\nx + y = 1\n\ny + z = 1\n\nz + x = 1\n\nThis is a system of three equations with three variables x, y, z. Let's solve this.\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second: (y + z) - (x + y) = 1 - 1 => z - x = 0 => z = x\n\nSubtract the second equation from the third: (z + x) - (y + z) = 1 - 1 => x - y = 0 => x = y\n\nThus, x = y = z.\n\nThen, substitute into first equation: x + x = 1 => 2x = 1 => x = 1/2\n\nThus, x = y = z = 1/2\n\nSo, x = a²/c = 1/2\n\ny = b²/a = 1/2\n\nz = c²/b = 1/2\n\nSo we have three equations:\n\n1) a²/c = 1/2\n\n2) b²/a = 1/2\n\n3) c²/b = 1/2\n\nLet me write these as:\n\na² = c/2\n\nb² = a/2\n\nc² = b/2\n\nSo now, we can substitute variables step by step.\n\nFrom the first equation: a² = c/2 => c = 2a²\n\nFrom the second equation: b² = a/2 => b = sqrt(a/2) or b = -sqrt(a/2). But since we are dealing with real numbers, a/2 must be non-negative, so a ≥ 0. Similarly, since c = 2a², c is non-negative.\n\nFrom the third equation: c² = b/2. But c = 2a², so c² = 4a⁴. Then, 4a⁴ = b/2 => b = 8a⁴\n\nBut from the second equation, b = sqrt(a/2) or -sqrt(a/2). Therefore:\n\n8a⁴ = sqrt(a/2) or 8a⁴ = -sqrt(a/2)\n\nBut 8a⁴ is always non-negative (since a⁴ is non-negative, multiplied by 8). However, sqrt(a/2) is real only if a/2 ≥ 0 => a ≥ 0. Similarly, -sqrt(a/2) is real only if a/2 ≥ 0 => a ≥ 0. But 8a⁴ is non-negative. So:\n\nCase 1: 8a⁴ = sqrt(a/2)\n\nCase 2: 8a⁴ = -sqrt(a/2)\n\nBut since the left side is non-negative and the right side is non-positive (because of the negative sign), the only way they can be equal is if both sides are zero. So:\n\nsqrt(a/2) = 0 => a/2 = 0 => a = 0\n\nBut if a = 0, then from the first equation, a²/c = 0 => 0 = 1/2, which is a contradiction. Therefore, Case 2 is invalid.\n\nTherefore, only Case 1: 8a⁴ = sqrt(a/2)\n\nBut let's check if this is possible. Let's set t = a. Then equation is 8t⁴ = sqrt(t/2)\n\nSquare both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n(8t⁴)² = (sqrt(t/2))² => 64t⁸ = t/2\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n128t⁸ = t\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n128t⁸ - t = 0 => t(128t⁷ - 1) = 0\n\nSolutions are t = 0 or 128t⁷ - 1 = 0 => t⁷ = 1/128 => t = (1/128)^(1/7)\n\nBut 128 is 2^7, so (1/128)^(1/7) = 2^(-7/7) = 2^(-1) = 1/2\n\nTherefore, t = 1/2 is the real solution (since t must be real and non-negative, but 1/2 is positive). However, we need to check if t = 1/2 satisfies the original equation.\n\nCheck t = 1/2:\n\nLeft side: 8*(1/2)^4 = 8*(1/16) = 0.5\n\nRight side: sqrt( (1/2)/2 ) = sqrt(1/4) = 1/2\n\nYes, 0.5 = 0.5. So t = 1/2 is a solution.\n\nTherefore, a = 1/2\n\nThen, from first equation: c = 2a² = 2*(1/2)^2 = 2*(1/4) = 0.5\n\nFrom second equation: b² = a/2 = (1/2)/2 = 1/4 => b = ±1/2\n\nBut wait, earlier we had from the third equation:\n\nc² = b/2 => (0.5)^2 = b/2 => 0.25 = b/2 => b = 0.5\n\nBut the second equation gives b = ±1/2. So there's a contradiction here. If b = -1/2, then c² = (-1/2)/2 = -1/4, which is impossible because c² is non-negative. Therefore, only b = 1/2 is valid.\n\nTherefore, a = 1/2, b = 1/2, c = 1/2.\n\nCheck this solution in the original equations:\n\nFirst equation: a³ + b²c = 1/8 + (1/2)^2*(1/2) = 1/8 + 1/4*(1/2) = 1/8 + 1/8 = 2/8 = 1/4\n\nRight side: a c = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4. Equal.\n\nSecond equation: b³ + c²a = (1/2)^3 + (1/2)^2*(1/2) = 1/8 + 1/4*(1/2) = 1/8 + 1/8 = 1/4\n\nLeft side: b a = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4. Equal.\n\nThird equation: c³ + a²b = (1/2)^3 + (1/2)^2*(1/2) = 1/8 + 1/4*(1/2) = 1/8 + 1/8 = 1/4\n\nLeft side: c b = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4. Equal.\n\nGreat, so (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) is a solution.\n\nNow, we need to check if there are any other solutions. Remember, we assumed all variables are non-zero. But maybe there are solutions where some variables are zero, but we already covered that case.\n\nWait, but we saw that if any variable is zero, all variables must be zero. So the only possible solutions are (0,0,0) and (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). Wait, but let me think again. When we derived x = y = z = 1/2, which led to the solution. But perhaps there's another solution where the variables are not all equal?\n\nWait, but in the system of equations we set x = a²/c, y = b²/a, z = c²/b, and we found that x = y = z = 1/2. So unless there are other solutions where x, y, z are not all equal, but that's the only solution to the system x + y =1, y + z=1, z + x=1. So the only solution is x=y=z=1/2. Therefore, the only solution is when a, b, c are all equal to 1/2.\n\nBut wait, let's check if there are other possibilities. Suppose that a, b, c are not all equal, but still satisfy the equations. For example, what if a, b, c are different?\n\nBut according to our previous derivation, the only solution is the symmetric one. Let's check if there could be other solutions where variables are unequal but still satisfy the equations.\n\nSuppose that a, b, c are not all equal. Let's see. Let's assume a ≠ b. Then, from equation (1) and (2), maybe we can find a relationship.\n\nFrom equation (1): a³ + b²c = a c\n\nFrom equation (2): b³ + c²a = b a\n\nLet me try to eliminate variables. Maybe express c from equation (1) in terms of a and b, then substitute into equation (2).\n\nFrom equation (1):\n\na³ + b²c = a c\n\n=> a³ = a c - b²c\n\n=> a³", "answer": "\\((a, b, c) = (0, 0, 0), \\ (a, b, c) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}\\right).\\)  \n\nJeśli \\(a = 0\\), to z drugiego równania otrzymujemy \\(b = 0\\).  \nPodobnie, jeśli \\(b = 0\\), to z trzeciego równania dostajemy \\(c = 0\\), a jeśli  \n\\(c = 0\\), to pierwsze równanie daje \\(a = 0\\).

So the problem is about placing as many points as possible on a 106x106 grid, with the condition that for any two points, at least one of the two conditions must hold: either one point is to the right and above the other within 10 units, or one is to the left and below the other within 10 units. Hmm. \n\nFirst, I need to visualize this. The grid has coordinates from 1 to 106 in both x and y directions. Each point (x, y) must be placed such that for any other point (x', y'), either (x > x' -10 and y > y' -10) or (x' > x -10 and y' > y -10). So, if I can imagine two points, one of them has to be in a region that's shifted 10 units to the right/left and down/up from the other. \n\nThis seems like a problem related to covering the grid with regions such that any two points are in adjacent regions. Maybe like a checkerboard pattern, but with some overlap? Wait, but the conditions are about being \"close\" in both x and y directions. \n\nLet me break down the condition. For any two points, either:\n\n1. One is in the positive (right, up) region relative to the other, within 10 units. So, if point A is (x, y), then point B could be (x - 10 + a, y - 10 + b) where a and b are >=1, but such that the distance in both x and y is <=10. Or,\n\n2. The other way around. So if A is (x, y), then B could be (x + 10 - a, y + 10 - b), where a and b are >=1, and the distance is <=10.\n\nWait, maybe another way to think about it is that the regions are such that any two points must be in regions that are adjacent in both x and y by at least 1 unit, but offset by at most 10 units. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me try to rephrase.\n\nIf we consider the grid as a coordinate system, each point must be placed such that there's a chain of points where each subsequent point is in a region that's shifted right and up by up to 10 units from the previous one. But this is for any two points. So, maybe it's similar to a graph where each node is connected if they are close enough in both directions. Then, the maximum independent set in this graph would give the maximum number of points we can place without violating the condition. But I'm not sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of this as a directed graph where edges represent the \"must be in close regions\" condition. Then, finding the maximum number of points with no two connected by an edge. But this might not be straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to model this as a grid and think in terms of regions. Let's consider dividing the grid into smaller regions such that if two points are in different regions, they must be in opposite regions (one being \"far\" to the right/left and up/down from the other).\n\nIf we can tile the grid with such regions, then the maximum number of points we can place is the size of the largest region. So, the question reduces to finding the maximum number of non-overlapping regions (each region being a set of points that are not adjacent in both x and y directions) such that the entire grid is covered. Then, the maximum number of points would be the maximum number of points in such a region.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each region is a \"donut\" shape or a square where points inside the region cannot have another point in their \"forbidden\" region. But I need to think more carefully.\n\nLet me consider smaller grids first to get an idea. Suppose the grid is 11x11. Then, for two points, one must be within 10 units in both x and y. Wait, but in a 11x11 grid, if you have a point at (1,1), then another point at (11,11) would satisfy the condition (x > x' -10 and y > y' -10). Similarly, (11,11) would require a point at (1,1). But in this case, the entire grid is connected through such pairs. However, in a 11x11 grid, points can be placed such that each is connected to the next one, forming a chain. But since the grid is finite, we can't have an infinite chain. So, the maximum number of points in such a chain would be roughly half of the grid? Wait, no. Let me see.\n\nWait, in a 11x11 grid, if we consider the condition that each point must have a \"successor\" point either to the right and above by 10 units or to the left and below by 10 units, then the maximum number of points would be 11, arranged in a diagonal line from (1,1) to (11,11), because each subsequent point is 10 units to the right and above the previous one. Similarly, the reverse direction is possible. But in a 11x11 grid, the diagonal from (1,1) to (11,11) is 11 points. Each consecutive pair satisfies the condition. So, in that case, the maximum number is 11.\n\nBut in a larger grid, say 16x16, what would happen? If we use a similar approach, arranging points along a diagonal separated by 10 units each time. Wait, but the distance in both x and y has to be at most 10. So, if we have points at (1,1), (11,11), (21,21), etc. But in a 16x16 grid, (11,11) is inside the grid. Then, the next point would be (21,21), which is outside. So, perhaps only 2 points. But that seems too low. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can divide the grid into regions where each region is a 11x11 square, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps the regions are overlapping in such a way that each point can only be in one region, and any two regions are adjacent in both x and y by at least 10 units. Then, the maximum number of regions would be the minimal such. But maybe I need to think in terms of graph coloring.\n\nAlternatively, let's model this as a graph where each point is a vertex, and edges connect points that satisfy the condition (i.e., one is to the right and above the other within 10 units OR one is to the left and below the other within 10 units). Then, the problem reduces to finding the maximum independent set in this graph. However, maximum independent set is NP-hard, but perhaps the graph has a particular structure that allows for an efficient solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find a pattern or a repeating unit that allows us to place points in such a way that they don't conflict, and then tile the entire grid with this unit. For example, if we can find a set of points spaced 11 units apart in both x and y directions, such that placing them in non-overlapping such regions maximizes the count. But since the grid is 106x106, which isn't a multiple of 11, we need to adjust.\n\nWait, 106 divided by 11 is 9.636..., so maybe 10 regions of 11x11? But 10*11=110, which is more than 106. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe a 10x10 arrangement? Wait, not sure.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Suppose we partition the grid into vertical strips of width 11. Each strip is 11 columns wide. Then, in each strip, if we can place points such that no two points are in conflicting regions. But since the condition is about both x and y being within 10 units, maybe arranging the points in a checkerboard pattern but offset every 11 units? Not sure.\n\nWait, another idea. Let's think of the grid as a graph where each node is connected to all nodes that are within 10 units in both x and y. Then, the problem is to find the maximum independent set. However, independent set in such a graph is tricky. But maybe we can find a structure where the graph is bipartite, and then the maximum independent set is half the total nodes. But is the graph bipartite?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the graph is a collection of chains, each of which can be colored with two colors, and then the maximum independent set is the sum of the number of nodes in each chain divided by two. But I need to check if the graph is bipartite.\n\nAlternatively, think of the grid as a directed graph where each node has edges to nodes that are \"next\" in the right/left and up/down directions. Then, the maximum independent set would be the largest set of nodes with no two connected by an edge. But again, this might not be straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to model this as a grid where we can place points in a way that they form a grid where each point is separated by at least 11 units in both x and y. Then, the maximum number of points would be the floor of 106/11 in both directions, but 106 divided by 11 is 9.636, so 9 in each direction, giving 9x9=81 points. But 106 - 9*11 = 106 - 99 =7, so maybe we can adjust for the remaining 7 columns. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, but if we space the points 11 units apart both horizontally and vertically, starting from (1,1), then the next point would be (12,12), then (23,23), etc. But since the grid is 106x106, the maximum number would be floor((106)/11) in each direction. Let's compute that. 106 divided by 11 is 9 with a remainder of 7. So 9 points along each axis. So total 81 points. But does this satisfy the condition? Let's check.\n\nIf we place a point at (x, y) and (x', y') such that x > x' -10 and y > y' -10, then x - x' > -10 and y - y' > -10. So x - x' < 11 and y - y' <11. Similarly, for the other condition, x' - x > -10 and y' - y > -10, so x' - x <11 and y' - y <11. So, in other words, the two points must be in regions that are within 10 units in both x and y. So, if we space them 11 units apart, the distance in x and y between them is at least 11, so they won't satisfy the condition. Therefore, this arrangement works. But wait, in this case, each point is 11 units apart, so the distance is 11, which is more than 10, so they don't satisfy the condition. Therefore, this arrangement is valid. So, in this case, the maximum number of points is 9x9=81. But wait, 9x9=81, but 9x11=99, which is less than 106. So, there are 7 columns remaining. Maybe we can place an extra point in those columns. For example, in column 100 (which is 99 +1), we can place a point at (100,1), then check if any other point in column 100 would conflict. But according to the spacing, the next point would be 11 units apart, which would be at (111,1), which is outside the grid. So, perhaps we can place 10 points in each column? Wait, but in each column, starting from 1 to 106, placing points at positions 1, 12, 23,..., up to 106. Let's see: 1 + 11k <=106. Solving for k, 11k <=105 => k<=9.545, so k=0 to9, which gives 10 points per column. Similarly, 10 columns would give 100 points, but the grid is 106x106. Wait, but columns are 106 columns. So, if we place 10 points in each column, that's 10x106=1060 points. But in each column, the points are spaced 11 units apart, so from 1 to 12, 23, 34, ..., 106. Each of these points is 11 units apart. But in the grid, there are 106 columns. Each column can have 10 points, and since 106/11 is 9.636, but 106 divided by 11 is 9 with remainder 7, so 10 points per column. Then, 10x106=1060. Wait, but 10*106=1060, which is more than 106x106=11236, but the grid is 106x106. Wait, no, the grid is 106x106, so each column has 106 points. But if we place 10 points per column, that would require 106 columns *10 points=1060 points. But the grid is 106x106=11236, so that's possible. But wait, but 106*10=1060. However, if we do this, then in each column, the points are spaced 11 units apart. So, in column 1, points at 1,12,23,...,106. Then, in column 2, points at 2,13,24,...,107. But column 2's maximum point is 107, which is within the grid (since columns go up to 106). Wait, 107 is beyond 106. So, actually, in column 2, the last point would be 107, which is outside the grid.

Hmm, this seems like a problem related to combinatorics and linear algebra. Let me start by breaking it down.\n\nFirst, let's parse the problem. We have a matrix A with entries a_ij where i < j, and each entry is either 0 or 1. The condition is that no matter which values x_i (each being -1 or 1) we choose, the sum of a_ij x_i x_j over all pairs i < j is either -1 or 1. We need to find the maximum number of non-zero entries (a_ij ≠ 0) possible under this condition.\n\nSo, the key is that for any possible combination of x_i's, the sum is constrained to -1 or 1. That seems like a strong condition. If the sum could take any value, then the matrix would be too \"free\" and we couldn't restrict the number of non-zero entries. But here, it's required to stay within two possibilities regardless of the choices of x_i. Therefore, the structure of the matrix must be such that the quadratic form is always constrained.\n\nLet me think about quadratic forms. For a quadratic form Q(x) = x^T A x, where A is a symmetric matrix (since the sum is over i < j, so a_ij = a_ji), then Q(x) = sum_{i < j} a_ij x_i x_j. The problem states that Q(x) must be in {-1, 1} for all x in {-1, 1}^n. Interesting. So the quadratic form is always ±1, regardless of the choice of x_i's.\n\nNow, quadratic forms over {-1, 1}^n... How do we characterize such matrices? Maybe there are some linear algebra techniques or combinatorial bounds here.\n\nLet me consider small cases first. Maybe that will give me some intuition.\n\nCase 1: n = 2. Then the only entry is a_12. The sum is a_12 x_1 x_2. We need a_12 x_1 x_2 ∈ {-1, 1} for all x_1, x_2 ∈ {-1, 1}. Let's compute possible a_12. If a_12 = 0, then the sum is 0, which is not allowed. If a_12 = 1, then the sum is x_1 x_2, which is either 1 or -1. Similarly, if a_12 = -1, the sum is -x_1 x_2, also 1 or -1. So in either case, the sum is ±1. Therefore, the only restriction is that a_12 must be non-zero. So for n = 2, the maximum number of non-zero entries is 1. Wait, but the problem says \"the maximum number of non-zero entries\", so if n=2, the answer is 1. But maybe there's a way to have more? But no, since there's only one entry. So for n=2, answer is 1.\n\nCase 2: n = 3. Now, we have three entries: a_12, a_13, a_23. Each can be 0 or 1. Let's see what constraints are imposed by the condition.\n\nFor any choice of x_1, x_2, x_3 ∈ {-1, 1}, the sum a_12 x_1 x_2 + a_13 x_1 x_3 + a_23 x_2 x_3 must be ±1.\n\nLet me try to set up equations for different x_i. Let's consider all possible combinations of x_i. Since each x_i is ±1, there are 2^3 = 8 possible combinations. The sum must be ±1 for each.\n\nBut maybe instead of enumerating all 8 cases, which might be tedious, we can find constraints on the matrix entries. Let's think about specific choices of x_i that can simplify the equation.\n\nFor example, fix x_1 = 1, x_2 = 1, x_3 = 1. Then the sum is a_12 * 1*1 + a_13 * 1*1 + a_23 * 1*1 = a_12 + a_13 + a_23. This must be either 1 or -1.\n\nSimilarly, fix x_1 = -1, x_2 = -1, x_3 = -1. Then the sum is a_12 * (-1)(-1) + a_13 * (-1)(-1) + a_23 * (-1)(-1) = a_12 + a_13 + a_23, same as before. So that gives the same equation. Hmm.\n\nAnother choice: x_1 = 1, x_2 = 1, x_3 = -1. Then the sum becomes a_12 *1*1 + a_13 *1*(-1) + a_23 *1*(-1) = a_12 - a_13 - a_23. This must be ±1.\n\nSimilarly, x_1 = 1, x_2 = -1, x_3 = 1: a_12*(-1) + a_13*1 + a_23*(-1) = -a_12 + a_13 - a_23 = ±1.\n\nx_1 = -1, x_2 = 1, x_3 = 1: a_12*1 + a_13*(-1) + a_23*(-1) = a_12 - a_13 - a_23 = ±1. Wait, this is the same as the previous case. Wait, no:\n\nWait, let's be precise. Let me list all 8 possible combinations:\n\n1. x1=1, x2=1, x3=1: sum = a12 + a13 + a23\n2. x1=1, x2=1, x3=-1: sum = a12 - a13 - a23\n3. x1=1, x2=-1, x3=1: sum = -a12 + a13 - a23\n4. x1=1, x2=-1, x3=-1: sum = a12 - a13 + a23\n5. x1=-1, x2=1, x3=1: sum = -a12 + a13 - a23\n6. x1=-1, x2=1, x3=-1: sum = -a12 + a13 + a23\n7. x1=-1, x2=-1, x3=1: sum = a12 + a13 - a23\n8. x1=-1, x2=-1, x3=-1: sum = -a12 - a13 - a23\n\nEach of these must equal either 1 or -1. So we have 8 equations, but actually, each equation is equal to ±1. So we need all these expressions to be ±1.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think about the possible values.\n\nNote that the sum a12 + a13 + a23 must be ±1. Similarly, the other expressions must be ±1. Let's try to set up some variables. Let me denote S1 = a12 + a13 + a23, S2 = -a12 + a13 - a23, S3 = a12 - a13 - a23, S4 = -a12 + a13 + a23, S5 = a12 + a13 - a23, S6 = -a12 - a13 + a23, S7 = -a12 - a13 - a23, S8 = a12 + a13 + a23. Wait, S1 to S8 are all the 8 cases. Each must be ±1.\n\nBut note that S1 and S8 are the same: S1 = S8 = a12 + a13 + a23. Similarly, S2 and S7 are the same: S2 = S7 = -a12 + a13 - a23. Wait, no, S2 is -a12 + a13 - a23, and S7 is -a12 - a13 - a23. Wait, that's different. Wait, actually, looking at S2 to S8:\n\nS1: +a12 +a13 +a23\n\nS2: -a12 +a13 -a23\n\nS3: +a12 -a13 -a23\n\nS4: -a12 +a13 +a23\n\nS5: +a12 +a13 -a23\n\nS6: -a12 -a13 +a23\n\nS7: -a12 -a13 -a23\n\nS8: +a12 +a13 +a23\n\nSo S1 and S8 are the same. Similarly, S4 and S8 are the same (wait S4 is -a12 +a13 +a23 which is same as S8: +a12 +a13 +a23? No, not exactly. Wait, no. Wait, -a12 +a13 +a23 vs a12 +a13 +a23. Different. So maybe there are 8 distinct equations. Wait, but S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7 are different. Let me check:\n\nS1: a12 + a13 + a23\n\nS2: -a12 + a13 - a23\n\nS3: a12 - a13 - a23\n\nS4: -a12 + a13 + a23\n\nS5: a12 + a13 - a23\n\nS6: -a12 - a13 + a23\n\nS7: -a12 - a13 - a23\n\nS8: a12 + a13 + a23\n\nSo S1 and S8 are the same. S4 and S8 are different. S7 and S4? S4 is -a12 +a13 +a23, S7 is -a12 -a13 -a23. So different. Similarly, S2 and S7?\n\nS2 is -a12 +a13 -a23\n\nS7 is -a12 -a13 -a23\n\nDifferent. So maybe all 8 are distinct?\n\nBut regardless, each must be ±1. So we have 8 equations, each equal to ±1. How can we solve for a12, a13, a23?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider that the sum a12 + a13 + a23 must be either 1 or -1, and similarly for other combinations. Let's suppose that a12 + a13 + a23 = 1. Then, other equations might impose restrictions.\n\nBut maybe it's better to consider that all these sums must be ±1, so possibly leading to constraints on the variables. For example, if we have a12 + a13 + a23 = 1, then in another case, say S5: +a12 +a13 -a23 = ±1. If a12 + a13 + a23 = 1, then S5 = (a12 + a13 + a23) - 2a23 = 1 - 2a23. So 1 - 2a23 must be ±1. Therefore, 1 - 2a23 = ±1. Solving:\n\nCase 1: 1 - 2a23 = 1 ⇒ -2a23 = 0 ⇒ a23 = 0.\n\nCase 2: 1 - 2a23 = -1 ⇒ -2a23 = -2 ⇒ a23 = 1.\n\nBut a23 is either 0 or 1. So if a23 = 0, then 1 - 2a23 = 1, which is allowed. If a23 = 1, then 1 - 2a23 = -1, which is also allowed. So either way, a23 can be 0 or 1. However, in this case, S5 is ±1, so 1 - 2a23 must be ±1. Therefore, a23 can be 0 or 1. But if a23 is 0, then S5 = 1 - 0 = 1. If a23 is 1, then S5 = 1 - 2 = -1. So both possibilities are allowed. But how does this relate to the other equations?\n\nAlternatively, if we set a12 + a13 + a23 = 1, then we have S1 = 1. Then, for S2: -a12 + a13 - a23 = ±1. Let me write this as -a12 + a13 - a23 = ±1. Let's assume S2 is 1. Then:\n\n-a12 + a13 - a23 = 1\n\nBut since a12 + a13 + a23 = 1, we can substitute a13 = 1 - a12 - a23 into the above equation:\n\n- a12 + (1 - a12 - a23) - a23 = 1\n\nSimplify:\n\n- a12 + 1 - a12 - a23 - a23 = 1\n\n-2a12 - 2a23 + 1 = 1\n\n-2a12 - 2a23 = 0\n\na12 + a23 = 0\n\nBut a12 and a23 are either 0 or 1. So a12 + a23 = 0 implies a12 = a23 = 0. But then from a12 + a13 + a23 = 1, we have 0 + a13 + 0 = 1 ⇒ a13 = 1. So we have a12 = a23 = 0, a13 = 1.

The function has two properties: it must be injective (condition 1) and satisfy the condition v + f(v) - w - f(w) = (am, bn) implying v = w (condition 2). \n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The set A_{m,n} consists of ordered pairs (k, l) where 0 ≤ k ≤ m-1 and 0 ≤ l ≤ n-1. So, it's like an m x n grid of points, right? The function f is a bijection (since it's injective and we're dealing with finite sets) from this grid to itself. \n\nCondition 2 says that if there exist integers a and b such that v + f(v) - w - f(w) equals (am, bn), then v must equal w. So, this condition is a kind of uniqueness. Even if we take two points v and w, if their images under f satisfy this equation with some a and b multiples of m and n, then v and w must be the same. \n\nHmm. So, the function f is designed in such a way that if two points differ by a certain vector (am, bn), then their images under f must differ by a different vector. Wait, but since f is a bijection, the only pair of points that differ by (am, bn) must map to a pair that also differ by (am, bn). But since their images are different points unless they are the same. Wait, maybe that's not the right way to think about it.\n\nLet me rephrase condition 2. Suppose we have two points v and w such that v + f(v) = w + f(w) + (am, bn). Then, f(v) - f(w) = w - v + (am, bn). But since f is a bijection, the only way this can happen is if v = w. Otherwise, there would be some other point in the grid that maps to v and w in a way that creates this difference. So, this condition ensures that no two distinct points can be paired in such a way that their images differ by (am, bn).\n\nSo, the function f is structured so that it doesn't allow any pair of points to have a \"difference vector\" (am, bn) in their images. That seems like a constraint on how f permutes the grid points.\n\nNow, since f is a bijection, we can also think of f as a permutation of the grid. So, perhaps we can model f as a permutation matrix or something similar. But let's think more carefully.\n\nLet me consider the case when m = n first. Maybe that's a simpler case to start with. Suppose m = n. Then, the grid is a square. Let's see if we can construct such a function here.\n\nSuppose we have a pair (a, b). Then, the condition is that if v + f(v) - w - f(w) = (a*m, b*n). Since m = n, that's (a*m, b*m). So, the sum v + f(v) - w - f(w) must equal (a*m, b*m). \n\nBut since f is a bijection, perhaps we can pair up elements such that each pair (v, f(v)) satisfies some condition. Wait, maybe if we consider the function f as a kind of translation or rotation that doesn't allow such additive shifts. Alternatively, maybe f can be defined as a permutation that avoids certain differences.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a graph problem. Consider each vertex (k, l) as a node, and edges that connect nodes which satisfy the condition v + f(v) - w - f(w) = (am, bn). Then, condition 2 is saying that the graph has no edges (since if there were an edge, that would mean two distinct nodes connected by an edge, which would imply v = w). Wait, no, actually, condition 2 is a bit different. It's not that there are no edges, but that if two nodes v and w are such that their images under f satisfy v + f(v) - w - f(w) = (am, bn), then v = w. So, actually, the graph would have edges between nodes v and w if such a pair exists, but the condition is that no two distinct nodes can be connected by such an edge. Wait, no, the condition is stronger. It's saying that if you have a pair of nodes v and w where the difference in their images is (am, bn), then they must be the same. So, the graph where edges are defined by this condition is actually a matching, but since the condition is for all a and b, not just specific ones, maybe it's more like a forbidden configuration.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a system of equations. Let's think about the coordinates. Let me denote v = (k, l) and f(v) = (k', l'). Then, the equation becomes (k + k', l + l') - (w + w', v + v') = (am, bn). Wait, no, the equation is v + f(v) - w - f(w) = (am, bn). So, for some integers a and b, we have:\n\nk + k' - w - w' = a*m\n\nl + l' - v - v' = b*n\n\nBut since v and w are in A_{m,n}, their coordinates are between 0 and m-1, so k', k, w', w are all in 0 to m-1, similarly for l and l'. Therefore, the left-hand side of the equation is (k - w) + (k' - w') in the x-coordinate and (l - v) + (l' - v') in the y-coordinate. But since k, w, k', w' are all between 0 and m-1, the differences (k - w) can be between -(m-1) and m-1, and similarly for the other terms. So, the total sum would be between -(2m - 2) and 2m - 2. Similarly for the y-coordinate.\n\nBut this seems a bit abstract. Maybe we can think of this as a system of equations. Let's consider the x-coordinate first:\n\n(k - w) + (k' - w') = a*m\n\nSimilarly for the y-coordinate:\n\n(l - v) + (l' - v') = b*n\n\nBut since k, w, k', w' are all in 0 ≤ ... ≤ m-1, the differences (k - w) and (k' - w') can range from -(m-1) to m-1. Therefore, their sum can range from -2(m-1) to 2(m-1). But the right-hand side is a*m, which is a multiple of m. So, unless m divides the sum on the left, which is (k - w) + (k' - w'), that would require that (k - w) + (k' - w') is a multiple of m. But since the left-hand side is between -2(m-1) and 2(m-1), the only way this can happen is if the sum is exactly 0, m, or -m.\n\nWait, for example, if m=1, then 2(m-1) = 0, so the sum on the left can only be 0. If m=2, then 2(m-1)=2, so the sum can be -2, -1, 0, 1, 2. But since the left-hand side is a multiple of m=2, the sum must be -2, 0, or 2. Similarly, for general m, the sum must be a multiple of m, so:\n\n(k - w) + (k' - w') ≡ 0 mod m\n\nSimilarly for the y-coordinate:\n\n(l - v) + (l' - v') ≡ 0 mod n\n\nBut the problem states that if such a pair (a, b) exists, then v = w. So, even if there is a pair (a, b), then v must equal w. Therefore, the only solution is that the difference (k - w) + (k' - w') is a multiple of m, and similarly for the y-coordinate difference, but even if these are multiples, the conclusion is that v = w. Wait, how does that work?\n\nWait, if the sum (k - w) + (k' - w') is a multiple of m, then maybe that implies that k - w = k' - w' mod m. But since k, w, k', w' are all in 0 to m-1, their differences are between -(m-1) and m-1. So, if the sum is a multiple of m, then either the sum is 0 or ±m. But if the sum is 0, then k - w = -(k' - w'), which implies k + k' = w + w'. Similarly for the y-coordinate, l + l' = v + v'.\n\nTherefore, if (k, l) and (k', l') differ by (a*m, b*n), then (k + k', l + l') - (w + w', v + v') = (a*m, b*n). But if (k - w, l - v) + (k' - w', l' - v') = (a*m, b*n), then if we let (k - w) = Δk, (w - k') = -Δk, etc., but I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, let's try to approach this with specific examples. Let's start with m = n = 1. Then, A_{1,1} is just the single element (0,0). The function f must map (0,0) to itself. Then, the condition 2 is trivially satisfied because there are no two distinct elements. So, for m = n = 1, there exists such a function. So, (1,1) is a possible pair.\n\nNow, let's check m = 2, n = 2. Let's see if we can construct such a function. The grid is 2x2. Let's try to define f such that it doesn't allow any two points v, w to have their images differ by (2a, 2b) unless v = w. Wait, since m = n = 2, the differences a and b are integers. So, the equation would be v + f(v) - w - f(w) = (2a, 2b). So, the sum of the coordinates of v + f(v) minus the sum of the coordinates of w + f(w) equals (2a, 2b). \n\nBut since f is a bijection, each pair of points must be mapped to a unique pair. Let's try to see if we can define f such that no two points differ by (2, 2) in their images. Hmm. Let's consider the possible pairs. For example, take the points (0,0) and (1,1). Suppose we map (0,0) to (0,0) and (1,1) to (1,1). Then, the difference between their images is (0,0), which is not (2a, 2b). But if we map (0,0) to (1,1) and (1,1) to (0,0), then the difference is (2,2). But according to condition 2, if there exist a and b such that (0,0) + f(0,0) - (1,1) + f(1,1) = (2a, 2b), then (0,0) must equal (1,1). But here, f(0,0) = (1,1) and f(1,1) = (0,0), so their images are swapped. Then, (0,0) + (1,1) - (1,1) + (0,0) = (0,0) + (0,0) = (0,0), which is (2*0, 2*0). So, this would imply that (0,0) = (1,1), which is false. So, that's okay.\n\nWait, but in this case, even though the images are swapped, the difference is (0,0), which is a multiple of 2*(0,0). So, since (0,0) is the only multiple of (2,2), the condition 2 is satisfied because the difference is (0,0). So, maybe this works. But is the function injective? Yes, because it's a permutation. So, for m = n = 2, perhaps this works. Let me check another pair. Take (0,1) and (1,0). Suppose we map (0,1) to (1,1) and (1,0) to (0,0). Then, the difference between their images is (1,1) - (0,0) = (1,1). But (1,1) is not a multiple of (2,2), so that's okay. Wait, no, the condition is about the sum of the coordinates. Wait, let's calculate the sum of the coordinates of v + f(v) - w - f(w). For (0,1) and (1,0), their images are (1,1) and (0,0). So, (0 + 1) + (1 + 0) - (1 + 0) + (1 + 0) = (1) + (1) - (1) + (1) = 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 = 2. So, (2, 2) is the result. But since m = 2, a and b can be any integers. So, 2*(1,1) = (2,2). Therefore, this would imply that (0,1) = (1,0), which is not the case. Therefore, this function would violate condition 2. Wait, but the difference in their images is (1,1), which is not a multiple of (2,2). So, in this case, the condition 2 is satisfied because there's no a and b such that the difference is (2,2). Therefore, this function is valid.\n\nBut wait, let's check another pair. Take (0,1) and (1,1). Their images are (1,1) and (0,0). The difference is (1,1). So, the sum of the coordinates is 1 + 1 = 2. But 2 is not a multiple of 2*2=4, so condition 2 is satisfied. Similarly, if we take (0,1) and (0,0). Their images are (1,1) and (0,0). The difference is (1,1). Sum is 2, which is not a multiple of 4, so condition 2 is satisfied. So", "answer": "Parę \\( (n, m) \\) nazwiemy dobrą, jeśli istnieje dobra funkcja \\( f : A_{n,m} \\to A_{n,m} \\).

", "response": "\nOkay, so I need to find the largest natural number n such that there exist n rectangles A_1, ..., A_n and n rectangles B_1, ..., B_n. Each A_i and B_i are rectangles with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The conditions are that these rectangles A_i and B_i are disjoint for all i, but every pair A_i and A_j (where i ≠ j) intersect, and similarly, every pair B_i and B_j (i ≠ j) intersect. Hmm, this seems a bit abstract. Let me try to unpack it step by step.\n\nFirst, let's restate the problem in my own words. We have two sets of n rectangles. The first set consists of rectangles A_1 to A_n, and the second set B_1 to B_n. Each A_i doesn't intersect with its corresponding B_i, but does intersect with all other A_j and B_k where j ≠ k. All rectangles are axis-aligned, so their sides are parallel to the x and y axes. The goal is to find the largest possible n where such a configuration exists.\n\nMaybe I should start with small values of n and see if I can find a pattern or some constraints.\n\nLet's consider n=1 first. Then we have one rectangle A_1 and one B_1. The conditions are that A_1 and B_1 do not intersect, but since there are no other rectangles, this is trivially true. So n=1 is possible.\n\nFor n=2, we need two rectangles A_1, A_2 and two rectangles B_1, B_2. The conditions are:\n\n1. A_1 and B_1 do not intersect.\n2. A_2 and B_2 do not intersect.\n3. A_1 and A_2 intersect.\n4. B_1 and B_2 intersect.\n5. Also, A_1 and A_2 are disjoint, B_1 and B_2 are disjoint, but A_1 and B_2 intersect, A_2 and B_1 intersect.\n\nSo, how can we arrange these rectangles?\n\nLet me visualize this. Suppose we have two A's and two B's. Let's try to place A_1 and A_2 such that they overlap, but A_1 doesn't overlap with B_1, and A_2 doesn't overlap with B_2. Similarly, B_1 and B_2 overlap, but A_1 doesn't overlap with B_2 and A_2 doesn't overlap with B_1.\n\nThis seems similar to a matching problem where each B_i needs to be placed in a way that it blocks A_i but allows the other A's to intersect each other. Maybe there's a way to arrange the Bs such that they are in different regions relative to the As.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using coordinate planes. Let's think of the coordinates of the rectangles. Let's assign coordinates to the bottom-left and top-right corners of each rectangle. Since the rectangles are axis-aligned, each rectangle is determined by its bottom-left (x1, y1) and top-right (x2, y2) corners, where x1 ≤ x2 and y1 ≤ y2.\n\nFor two rectangles to not intersect, their projections on both the x-axis and y-axis must not overlap. So, for A_1 and B_1 not to intersect, either A_1's x-interval (x1, x2) does not overlap with B_1's x-interval, or A_1's y-interval does not overlap with B_1's y-interval. Similarly for other pairs.\n\nBut in this case, since A_1 and B_1 don't intersect, and A_2 and B_2 don't intersect, but all other A's and B's intersect. So, for example, A_1 must intersect with B_2, A_2 intersects with B_1, and both B_1 and B_2 intersect each other.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates.\n\nLet me assume that the rectangles are placed in the plane with coordinates. Let's say A_1 is placed somewhere, and B_1 is placed such that it doesn't overlap with A_1. Similarly, A_2 overlaps with B_2, and B_1 overlaps with A_2. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to model this as a bipartite graph. On one side, we have the A rectangles, and on the other side, we have the B rectangles. Each A_i is connected to every B_j where i ≠ j and B_j is not overlapping with A_i. Similarly, each B_j is connected to every A_i where i ≠ j and A_i is not overlapping with B_j. But since all A_i and B_j must intersect with each other when i ≠ j, this seems like a complete bipartite graph, but with some edges missing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this is a problem related to graph coloring or hypergraphs. But perhaps I need a simpler approach.\n\nLet me consider the problem in terms of coordinates. Suppose we have two sets of rectangles. Each A_i is a rectangle that does not intersect with B_i, but intersects with every other A and B. So, for each i, B_i is placed such that it is entirely within the union of all A_j for j ≠ i. Similarly, A_i is placed such that it is entirely within the union of all B_j for j ≠ i.\n\nWait, that might be a key insight. If B_i is entirely within the union of all A_j except A_i, then B_i cannot overlap with A_i, since A_i is outside of its own union. Similarly, A_i is within the union of all B_j except B_i, so A_i cannot overlap with B_i.\n\nBut also, the union of all B_j's is the same as the union of all A_i's, because each A_i is within the union of B_j's except B_i. Similarly, each B_j is within the union of A_i's except A_j.\n\nWait, let's formalize this. Let S_A = union of all A_i's. Then, for each i, B_i is a subset of S_A \\ A_i. Similarly, S_B = union of all B_j's. For each j, A_j is a subset of S_B \\ B_j.\n\nBut since S_B is the union of all B_j's, and each A_j is a subset of S_B \\ B_j, then S_B must contain all A_j's. Similarly, S_A must contain all B_j's.\n\nMoreover, the key point is that for each i, B_i is within S_A \\ A_i, which is the union of all A_j except A_i. So, B_i is a subset of that union. Similarly, A_i is a subset of the union of all B_j except B_j.\n\nTherefore, the union of all A_i's is equal to the union of all B_i's, because each A_i is inside S_B, which is the union of all B_j's, and each B_j is inside S_A, which is the union of all A_i's. So, S_A = S_B.\n\nTherefore, the union of all A_i's is equal to the union of all B_j's. Let's denote this common union as S.\n\nMoreover, each A_i is a subset of S \\ B_i, and each B_j is a subset of S \\ A_j.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to arranging n rectangles in the plane such that:\n\n1. The union of all A_i's is S.\n2. Each A_i is contained within S \\ B_i.\n3. Each B_j is contained within S \\ A_j.\n\nAdditionally, for each i, A_i and B_i do not intersect.\n\nBut how can we arrange such a configuration?\n\nLet me think of a coordinate system. Let's place the origin at some point. Maybe arrange the A rectangles in a way that their union is a large rectangle, and the B rectangles are arranged to block each A_i but still overlap with others.\n\nWait, suppose S is a very large rectangle. Then, if we place each A_i in such a way that they are all within S, but each A_i is blocked by B_i. So, B_i is placed in a region that is inside S but not overlapping with A_i. Similarly, each B_j is placed such that it overlaps with all A_i where i ≠ j.\n\nThis is somewhat similar to a covering problem with overlapping regions. Maybe arranging the rectangles in a grid-like structure?\n\nFor example, let's consider n=2. Let's try to create two A's and two B's.\n\nSuppose we have a large rectangle S. Place A_1 in the bottom-left quadrant and A_2 in the top-right quadrant. Then place B_1 in the top-left quadrant and B_2 in the bottom-right quadrant. But then, B_1 is in the top-left, which doesn't overlap with A_1 (which is in the bottom-left). Similarly, B_2 doesn't overlap with A_2. However, A_1 and A_2 overlap in the middle of S, but since they are in different quadrants, they might not overlap. Wait, if they are in different quadrants, they might not overlap. For example, if A_1 is from (0,0) to (1,1), and A_2 is from (2,2) to (3,3), then they are disjoint. Similarly, B_1 and B_2 are in (1,1) to (2,2) and (3,3) to (4,4), which are disjoint as well. But then, A_1 and B_2: A_1 is (0,0)-(1,1), B_2 is (3,3)-(4,4). They don't overlap. Similarly, A_2 and B_1: (2,2)-(3,3) and (1,1)-(2,2). They only touch at a line, but according to the problem statement, points on the boundary are considered as part of the rectangle. So, the lines are included, but do they count as intersecting? The problem says \"intersect\" for all i ≠ j. Since the rectangles are axis-aligned, the only way they don't intersect is if they are disjoint. If they touch at a boundary point, they might be considered intersecting? Wait, the problem says \"intersect\". So, do the rectangles count as intersecting if they share a boundary point?\n\nThe problem statement mentions: \"Prove that the natural number n is the largest possible number such that there exists n rectangles A_1, ..., A_n and B_1, ..., B_n, each with sides parallel to the coordinate axis, such that A_i and B_i do not intersect for all i ∈ {1, ..., n}, but A_i and A_j intersect for all i ≠ j, and B_i and B_j intersect for all i ≠ j.\"\n\nThe key is to check whether the problem considers two rectangles as intersecting if they touch at a boundary point. For example, if two rectangles share a side, then they intersect, even if only at a single point. So, in that case, touching at a point would count as intersecting. Therefore, in the A_1 and B_2 example, if A_1 is (0,0)-(1,1) and B_2 is (1,1)-(2,2), their intersection is just the point (1,1). Since the problem allows for points on the boundary to be considered intersecting, then A_1 and B_2 would intersect. But the problem states that A_i and B_j must intersect for all i ≠ j. So, in the case where i and j are different, even if the rectangles only touch at a boundary point, they should still count as intersecting.\n\nTherefore, in our previous example, if we have A_1 in the bottom-left, B_1 in the top-right, A_2 in the top-left, and B_2 in the bottom-right, then each A_i and B_j would intersect. For example, A_1 and B_2 intersect at (1,1), which is a boundary point. Similarly, A_2 and B_1 intersect at (1,1). So, even though they only touch at a point, they intersect. Therefore, this configuration works for n=2.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the union of all A_i's is S, which is the entire plane, but each A_i is arranged in different quadrants. However, in reality, we can't have infinitely many rectangles, but the problem states \"natural number n\", so we need to find the maximum n where such a configuration is possible.\n\nBut in the case of n=2, this works. What about n=3?\n\nLet's try n=3. We need three rectangles A_1, A_2, A_3 and three rectangles B_1, B_2, B_3. Each A_i must intersect all B_j for j ≠ i, and each B_i must intersect all A_j for j ≠ i. Also, A_i and B_i must not intersect.\n\nThis seems more complex. Let's think of how to place the A and B rectangles.\n\nIf we try to extend the previous idea, but with n=3. Suppose we have a large rectangle S. Place A_1, A_2, A_3 in different regions of S such that each A_i is in a different quadrant. Wait, but with three rectangles, it's challenging to place them without overlapping. Alternatively, maybe arranging them in a grid.\n\nAlternatively, think of the A rectangles as forming a covering of S, each A_i covering a different part of S, and the B rectangles as covering the remaining parts, but arranged such that each B_i covers parts that overlap with all A_j's except A_i.\n\nWait, perhaps arranging the A rectangles in a way that each A_i is in a different quadrant of S, and each B_i is in a different quadrant as well, but shifted in such a way that each B_i blocks its corresponding A_i but overlaps with the others.\n\nBut with three rectangles, it's tricky. Let me try to sketch this mentally.\n\nSuppose S is a square from (0,0) to (10,10). Let's divide S into three regions for the A rectangles. For example, three horizontal strips: the topmost strip, the middle strip, and the bottom strip. Similarly, for the B rectangles, three vertical strips: leftmost, middle, rightmost. Each A_i is in a horizontal strip, and each B_j is in a vertical strip. Then, each A_i intersects all B_j's except its own strip. But wait, if A_i is in the horizontal strip and B_j is in a vertical strip, unless the vertical strip is the same as the horizontal strip, they might not intersect. Wait, no. If A_i is in the top strip and B_j is in the left strip, their intersection would be empty because their x-intervals don't overlap. Similarly, if they are in different strips. So, this approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, arrange the A rectangles and B rectangles in a way that each B_j covers a region that overlaps with all A_i's except A_j. So, each B_j must be in the intersection of the A_i's except A_j. But the intersection of A_i's is a small region, so B_j must be placed in that small region. But if there are multiple A_i's, their intersection could be a narrow region.\n\n", "answer": "Największą liczbą spełniającą warunki zadania jest *n = 4.* Poniższy rysunek przedstawia przykład dla *n = 4.*"}

Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem better.\n\nFirst, the total area of the chessboard is 15x15 = 225 squares. Each 3x3 tile covers 9 squares, and the 1x1 tiles cover 1 square each. Let's denote the number of 3x3 tiles as 'k' and the number of 1x1 tiles as 'm'. The equation for the total area would be 9k + m = 225. So, m = 225 - 9k. Since we need at least one 1x1 tile, m must be at least 1, which means 225 - 9k ≥ 1. Solving for k gives k ≤ (225 - 1)/9 = 224/9 ≈ 24.88. So, k can be at most 24. But the question asks for the minimum number of 3x3 tiles needed. That would correspond to the maximum number of 1x1 tiles we can have, which would minimize k. Wait, but we need to check if such a tiling is possible.\n\nBut maybe there's another constraint. The arrangement of the 3x3 tiles and the 1x1 tiles must fit together without overlapping and without leaving gaps. So, even if mathematically k could be as low as possible, due to the geometry, maybe the actual minimum k is higher.\n\nLet me think. Each 3x3 tile occupies a 3x3 section. Since the chessboard is 15x15, which is divisible by 3 (15/3 = 5), the chessboard can be perfectly divided into 5x5 = 25 blocks of 3x3 squares. But if we use fewer 3x3 tiles, we would have overlapping regions where 1x1 tiles need to be placed. However, overlapping isn't allowed, so the remaining area must be covered by 1x1 tiles. Let me calculate how many 3x3 tiles would leave the maximum number of 1x1 regions.\n\nIf we use k 3x3 tiles, the total area covered by them is 9k. The remaining area is 225 - 9k, which must be equal to m, the number of 1x1 tiles. So, the problem reduces to finding the smallest k such that 225 - 9k is a perfect square (since m must be a non-negative integer), but also that the arrangement of the 3x3 tiles allows the remaining 1x1 tiles to fit without overlapping.\n\nWait, but maybe m doesn't have to be a perfect square. The remaining area is a rectangle, but the 3x3 tiles might not fit into the remaining area. However, since the entire chessboard is 15x15, which is divisible by 3, the remaining area after placing k 3x3 tiles would have to be a multiple of 3 in both dimensions. Wait, no. Let's see. If we place 3x3 tiles, the remaining space would have dimensions that are not divisible by 3, unless the placement of the 3x3 tiles is such that the remaining area is also divisible by 3. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nSuppose we place 3x3 tiles in such a way that they cover certain parts of the board, leaving the rest as 1x1 regions. Each 3x3 tile occupies a 3x3 block. If the entire board is covered, then the remaining area must be filled with 1x1 tiles. But if we place fewer 3x3 tiles, the remaining area would have to be made up of 1x1 tiles. However, the remaining area has to be partitionable into 1x1 squares, which it is, but their arrangement might not allow the 3x3 tiles to fit. Wait, but the remaining area is a union of regions not covered by the 3x3 tiles. If the 3x3 tiles are placed in a grid pattern, the remaining areas would be smaller regions that need to be covered with 1x1 tiles. However, if the 3x3 tiles are placed in a way that leaves larger regions, maybe those regions can be covered with 1x1 tiles, but the 3x3 tiles themselves would need to fit into the remaining area. Wait, but the 3x3 tiles are squares, so their placement would require that the remaining areas accommodate them. This seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as a tiling problem where we need to place 3x3 tiles in the 15x15 grid such that the remaining squares are covered by 1x1 tiles. Each 3x3 tile placed in the grid will occupy a 3x3 area, and the rest of the squares must be 1x1. So, the key is to find the minimal number of 3x3 tiles such that the remaining area can be covered by 1x1 tiles. But the challenge is that the remaining area has to be partitioned into 3x3 blocks. Wait, no, the remaining area can have any arrangement, as long as it's covered by 1x1 tiles. But the 3x3 tiles must fit into the remaining area. Wait, no. The 3x3 tiles are placed on the chessboard, and the remaining squares are 1x1. So, the 3x3 tiles can't overlap the 1x1 tiles. Therefore, the 3x3 tiles must be placed such that their positions don't interfere with the 1x1 tiles. So, the 3x3 tiles can be placed anywhere, but each 3x3 tile must be entirely within the chessboard and not overlap with the 1x1 tiles. Therefore, the positions of the 3x3 tiles are fixed, and their placement must not interfere with the 1x1 tiles. Wait, but the problem states that the tiles are placed on the chessboard such that they don't overlap and don't cover the chessboard. So, the 3x3 tiles are placed on the chessboard, and the 1x1 tiles fill the remaining parts. So, the 3x3 tiles can't overlap with the 1x1 tiles, but they can be anywhere on the chessboard. So, the 3x3 tiles can be placed in any positions, as long as the remaining parts are 1x1. So, the question is, what is the minimal number of 3x3 tiles needed so that the remaining area can be filled with 1x1 tiles. But the problem is not about arranging the tiles such that the remaining area is filled with 1x1 tiles, but rather arranging the tiles on the chessboard such that all squares are covered. Wait, no. The problem says that the chessboard is tiled with 3x3 tiles and 1x1 tiles. So, the entire chessboard must be covered by the tiles. So, the 3x3 tiles cover 9 squares each, and the 1x1 tiles cover 1 square each. Therefore, the total number of tiles is k + m, where 9k + m = 225. The question is to find the minimal k such that this tiling is possible.\n\nSo, the minimal k would correspond to the maximal number of 1x1 tiles that can be placed, which would require the 3x3 tiles to be placed in such a way that they don't interfere with the remaining 1x1 regions. But since the chessboard is 15x15, which is divisible by 3, maybe the minimal k is 24, as 24*9 = 216, so m = 225 - 216 = 9. So, 24 3x3 tiles and 9 1x1 tiles. But is this possible? Let's check.\n\nIf we use 24 3x3 tiles, that covers 216 squares, leaving 9 squares. The question is whether those 9 squares can be covered by 1x1 tiles. However, the problem is that the 3x3 tiles might not fit into the remaining 9 squares. For example, if the remaining 9 squares are in a 3x3 area, then you can place one 3x3 tile there, but that would overlap with the existing tiles. Wait, no. The existing tiles are 3x3, so the remaining 9 squares must form regions that can be covered by 1x1 tiles without overlapping with the existing tiles.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let's try to model this. Suppose we place 24 3x3 tiles on the 15x15 board. Since 15 is a multiple of 3, we can divide the board into a 5x5 grid of 3x3 blocks. Each 3x3 block contains 9 squares. If we place 3x3 tiles in all 25 positions, we need 25 tiles, but we only use 24, leaving one 3x3 block uncovered. However, in that case, the remaining 9 squares would be a 3x3 block, which can be covered by one 3x3 tile. But that would mean using 25 3x3 tiles, which is more than 24. So, 24 3x3 tiles would leave 9 squares, but those 9 squares would have to be covered by 1x1 tiles. However, if we leave a 3x3 block uncovered, we can't place another 3x3 tile there, so we have to fill those 9 squares with 1x1 tiles. But the problem is that the 3x3 tiles are placed on the chessboard, so the remaining 3x3 block is part of the chessboard. Wait, but if we leave a 3x3 block uncovered, that would mean that the remaining area is 15x15 minus a 3x3 block. But 15x15 minus a 3x3 block is 225 - 9 = 216, which is divisible by 9. So, perhaps we can have a 24 3x3 tiles and 9 1x1 tiles. But how?\n\nWait, maybe arrange the 3x3 tiles in such a way that they form a grid with 3x3 blocks, but leave one 3x3 block empty. For example, imagine dividing the 15x15 board into 5x5=25 3x3 blocks. If we place 24 3x3 tiles, covering all but one of these blocks. Then, the remaining block is a 3x3 area, which can be covered by one 3x3 tile, but that 3x3 tile would overlap with the existing 24 tiles. Wait, no. The existing tiles are already covering 24 blocks, each of which is 3x3. So, if we leave one block empty, that's 3x3=9 squares. But how do we place a 3x3 tile on the remaining block? It would overlap with the existing tiles, which is not allowed. Therefore, we cannot leave a 3x3 block empty. Therefore, all remaining 9 squares must be covered by 1x1 tiles. But the problem is that those 9 squares might not form a contiguous block. For example, if we leave a 3x3 block empty, the remaining 9 squares form a cross shape, perhaps. In that case, we would need to cover those 9 squares with 1x1 tiles, but the 3x3 tiles might interfere with the placement. Wait, but the 3x3 tiles are placed on the chessboard, so they are fixed. If the remaining 9 squares are in a cross shape, perhaps we can place 1x1 tiles in those positions. But the problem is that the 3x3 tiles are already placed, and their positions might limit where the 1x1 tiles can go. For example, if we have a 3x3 tile in the top-left corner, the remaining squares above and to the right would be covered by 1x1 tiles. But the 3x3 tile in the top-left corner is already occupying the top-left 3x3 area. So, the squares above and to the right would be the 3x3 area starting at (4,1) to (6,3), but wait, 15x15. Wait, maybe I need to visualize this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of 3x3 tiles is 24, which allows 9 1x1 tiles. But how do we actually arrange 24 3x3 tiles and 9 1x1 tiles? Let's think of the 15x15 board divided into 5x5=25 3x3 blocks. If we place 24 3x3 tiles, each covering a 3x3 block, leaving one 3x3 block uncovered. Then, the uncovered block is 9 squares, which we need to cover with 1x1 tiles. But the problem is that the 3x3 tiles are placed on the chessboard, so the uncovered block could be anywhere, but the 3x3 tiles are already placed in their respective blocks. However, if the uncovered block is adjacent to the 3x3 tiles, we might not be able to place the 1x1 tiles there. Wait, no. The 3x3 tiles are on the chessboard, and the 1x1 tiles are filling the remaining squares. So, the 3x3 tiles are placed on the chessboard, and the 1x1 tiles fill the rest. But if the uncovered 3x3 block is part of the chessboard, then the 3x3 tiles are placed in 24 blocks, leaving one block uncovered. However, the 1x1 tiles would have to fill that uncovered block, which is 3x3, but how? If the 3x3 tiles are placed in the 5x5 grid, the uncovered block is a 3x3 area. But if that area is not in the same position as the 3x3 tiles, we can place 1x1 tiles there. Wait, but if the 3x3 tiles are placed anywhere, their positions affect the areas they cover. For example, if the 3x3 tiles are placed in a diagonal pattern, leaving a 3x3 block of squares somewhere, then we can place 1x1 tiles in that area. However, the problem is that the 3x3 tiles are already occupying those squares, so we can't place the 1x1 tiles there. Wait, no. The 1x1 tiles are the ones that fill the remaining squares. The 3x3 tiles are placed on the chessboard, and the 1x1 tiles fill the rest. So, if there's a 3x3 area that's not covered by any 3x3 tiles", "answer": "Najmniejszą liczbą płytek 3×3, dla której przykrycie z treści zadania jest możliwe jest 9."}

The problem is about finding the maximum number of beautiful pairs (i, j) that can be formed by coloring each number from 1 to 2n-1 either red or blue. A beautiful pair is defined as a pair where the interval from i to j (inclusive) contains an odd number of blue numbers. The goal is to determine the maximum possible number of such pairs depending on n.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have numbers 1 to 2n-1 arranged in a sequence. Each number is colored either red or blue. A beautiful pair (i, j) is when the interval [i, j] has an odd count of blue numbers. We need to color the numbers such that the total number of beautiful pairs is maximized. Then, we have to find this maximum number for each n.\n\nHmm. So, the key here is to figure out a coloring strategy that maximizes the number of intervals [i, j] with an odd number of blue numbers. Let's start by considering small values of n to see if we can find a pattern.\n\nLet's start with n = 1. Then the numbers are 1 to 1 (since 2*1 - 1 = 1). So there's only one number, which is 1. The possible pairs are (1,1). The interval [1,1] must have an odd number of blue numbers. The number 1 is colored either red or blue. If it's colored blue, then the interval has one blue number (odd), so it's a beautiful pair. If it's colored red, then the interval has zero blue numbers (even), so it's not beautiful. Therefore, the maximum number of beautiful pairs is 1. But since there's only one possible pair, the answer is 1.\n\nWait, but n = 1 is trivial. Let's check n = 2. Then the numbers are 1, 2, 3. The possible pairs are (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (1,2), (2,3), (1,3). So six pairs in total. We need to color each number red or blue to maximize the number of these intervals with an odd number of blue numbers.\n\nLet me try to figure out a coloring pattern. Let's see. If we color numbers alternately red and blue, maybe that could help. For example, color 1 red, 2 blue, 3 red. Then, let's check each interval:\n\n(1,1): 1 red → 0 blue → even → not beautiful.\n\n(2,2): 2 blue → 1 blue → odd → beautiful.\n\n(3,3): 3 red → 0 blue → even → not beautiful.\n\n(1,2): 1 red and 2 blue → 1 blue → odd → beautiful.\n\n(2,3): 2 blue and 3 red → 1 blue → odd → beautiful.\n\n(1,3): 1 red, 2 blue, 3 red → 1 blue → odd → beautiful.\n\nSo beautiful pairs here are (2,2), (1,2), (2,3), (1,3) → 4 beautiful pairs. Total pairs 6, so 4 beautiful. Is this the maximum? Let's see if another coloring could give more.\n\nSuppose we color all numbers blue. Then:\n\n(1,1): 1 blue → 1 (odd) → beautiful.\n\n(2,2): 1 blue → 1 → beautiful.\n\n(3,3): 1 blue → 1 → beautiful.\n\n(1,2): 2 blues → 2 (even) → not beautiful.\n\n(2,3): 2 blues → 2 (even) → not beautiful.\n\n(1,3): 3 blues → 3 (odd) → beautiful.\n\nSo beautiful pairs are (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (1,3) → 4. Same as before. If we color all red, similar to n=1, we get 1 beautiful pair. So 4 is better. So alternating seems good here.\n\nWhat if we color 1 blue, 2 red, 3 blue? Then:\n\n(1,1): 1 blue → 1 → beautiful.\n\n(2,2): 1 red → 0 → even → not.\n\n(3,3): 1 blue → 1 → beautiful.\n\n(1,2): 1 blue, 1 red → 1 → beautiful.\n\n(2,3): 1 red, 1 blue → 1 → beautiful.\n\n(1,3): 2 blues → 2 → even.\n\nSo beautiful pairs: (1,1), (3,3), (1,2), (2,3) → 4. Same as before.\n\nSo it seems that alternating colors gives us 4 beautiful pairs for n=2. Let's check another pattern. Suppose we color 1 red, 2 blue, 3 blue. Then:\n\n(1,1): 0 → even.\n\n(2,2): 1 → odd.\n\n(3,3): 1 → odd.\n\n(1,2): 1 blue → odd.\n\n(2,3): 2 blues → even.\n\n(1,3): 2 blues → even.\n\nBeautiful pairs: (2,2), (3,3), (1,2) → 3. Which is worse. So alternating seems better.\n\nSo for n=2, maximum beautiful pairs is 4.\n\nLet me note that 4 is 2^(2-1) = 2, but 2^(n-1) gives 2 for n=2. Wait, but 4 is 2*2. Hmm. Wait, 2n-1 is 3, so maybe it's not directly related. Let's see n=3. Let's try to see if there's a pattern.\n\nFor n=3, numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Total of 5 numbers. Let's try to find a coloring that maximizes the number of beautiful pairs.\n\nIf we use the alternating strategy: color 1 red, 2 blue, 3 red, 4 blue, 5 red. Then check the intervals.\n\nBut wait, maybe a better pattern. Let's see. Let's color all odds blue and evens red. Then, for each number, odd positions are blue, even are red.\n\nThen, the number of blue numbers in an interval [i, j] depends on the number of odd numbers in that interval. If the interval starts and ends with odd, then the number of odds is (j - i + 1) - (number of evens). Since evens are j - i + 1 - number of odds. So the count of blue numbers is (number of odds in interval). So beautiful pairs are intervals where the number of odds (blue numbers) is odd.\n\nSo how many intervals have an odd number of odds?\n\nAlternatively, if we color odds blue and evens red, then the number of blue numbers in [i, j] is the number of odds in [i, j]. So we need the number of intervals [i, j] with an odd number of odds in [i, j].\n\nThis is equivalent to counting the number of intervals with an odd number of elements in the set of odds. The odds are 1,3,5,... up to 2n-1. Wait, for n=3, it's 1,3,5.\n\nThe number of such intervals can be calculated as follows. For a set of k elements, the number of intervals with an odd number of elements is 2^(k-1). Because for each element, you choose to include it or not, but if you want an odd count, you have to balance the inclusion of each element such that the total is odd. The total number is 2^{k-1}.\n\nSo for example, for k=3 odds: 1,3,5. The number of intervals with odd length is C(3,1) + C(3,3) = 3 + 1 = 4. So 4 intervals. Wait, but the total number of intervals is 15, and half of them have odd length. Wait, actually, for a set of k elements, the number of subsets with even size is equal to the number of subsets with odd size, which is 2^{k-1}. So yes, half of the intervals have even length and half have odd length. But wait, that's only true if the subsets are considered as elements of the power set. However, in our case, intervals are ordered and non-empty? Wait, no, intervals can be non-empty. So for k=3, the number of intervals with odd length is 2^{3-1} = 4. Let's check:\n\nIntervals of length 1: 3 intervals (1,3,5). All have odd length. So 3.\n\nIntervals of length 3: 1 interval (1,3,5). Length is 3 (odd). So 1.\n\nTotal: 4, which is 2^{3-1} = 4. Correct.\n\nTherefore, if we color all odds blue and evens red, the number of beautiful pairs is 4. But in the previous case for n=2, when we colored alternately blue and red, we also got 4. Wait, but maybe there's a way to get more.\n\nWait, for n=3, if we color all numbers red, then the only beautiful pair is (1,1). If we color all blue, the beautiful pair is (5,5). If we color some red and some blue, maybe we can get more.\n\nLet me try coloring 1,2,3,4,5 as follows: red, blue, red, blue, red. So positions 1,3,5 are red, 2,4 are blue. Then:\n\nNumber of blue numbers in an interval [i,j] is equal to the number of blue numbers in that interval. The blue numbers are at 2 and 4. So the intervals with 1 blue number: [2,2], [4,4]. Each has length 1 (odd). So those are 2 beautiful pairs.\n\nIntervals with 2 blue numbers: [2,4], which has length 3 (odd). So 1 beautiful pair.\n\nIntervals with 0 blue numbers: [1,1], [3,3], [5,5]. Each has length 1 (odd). So 3.\n\nTotal: 2 + 1 + 3 = 6. So 6 beautiful pairs for n=3. Wait, that's more than the 4 from the alternating coloring.\n\nHmm. So coloring all odds red and evens blue gives 6 beautiful pairs? Wait, let's check again.\n\nWait, if we color evens blue and odds red, then the blue numbers are at 2 and 4. So in an interval [i,j], the number of blue numbers is the number of blue numbers in [i,j]. So:\n\n- [1,1]: 0 (even) → not beautiful.\n\n- [2,2]: 1 (odd) → beautiful.\n\n- [3,3]: 0 → even.\n\n- [4,4]: 1 → beautiful.\n\n- [1,2]: 1 (blue at 2) → odd.\n\n- [2,3]: 1 (blue at 2) → odd.\n\n- [3,4]: 1 (blue at 4) → odd.\n\n- [1,3]: 1 (blue at 2) → odd.\n\n- [2,4]: 2 (blue at 2 and 4) → even.\n\n- [3,5]: 1 (blue at 4) → odd.\n\n- [1,5]: 2 (blue at 2 and 4) → even.\n\nSo beautiful pairs are [2,2], [4,4], [1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,3], [3,5]. That's 7 beautiful pairs. Wait, how does that add up?\n\nWait, let's count:\n\n- [2,2]: yes.\n\n- [4,4]: yes.\n\n- [1,2]: yes.\n\n- [2,3]: yes.\n\n- [3,4]: yes.\n\n- [1,3]: yes.\n\n- [3,5]: yes.\n\nThat's 7 beautiful pairs. Wait, that's 7, which is more than the 6 from the alternating coloring. Hmm. So perhaps coloring all evens blue and odds red gives more beautiful pairs. Wait, but 7 is more than 6. Let's check again.\n\nWait, total intervals for n=3 is 15. 2 (single-element intervals) + 3 (length 2) + 2 (length 3) + 2 (length 4) + 1 (length 5) = 10? Wait, no. Wait, the number of intervals is sum_{k=1}^n k = n(n+1)/2. For n=3, 3*4/2=6. Wait, but that can't be. Wait, no, for the sequence from 1 to m, the number of intervals is m(m+1)/2. For m=5 (since n=3, 2n-1=5), the number of intervals is 5*6/2=15. So 15 intervals. Then in the coloring where blues are at 2 and 4, the number of beautiful pairs is 7. Let's verify:\n\nFor each interval:\n\n1: [1,1] → 0 → even → not.\n\n2: [2,2] → 1 → yes.\n\n3: [3,3] → 0 → no.\n\n4: [4,4] → 1 → yes.\n\n5: [5,5] → 0 → no.\n\n6: [1,2] → 1 → yes.\n\n7: [2,3] → 1 → yes.\n\n8: [3,4] → 1 → yes.\n\n9: [4,5] → 1 → yes.\n\n10: [1,3] → 1 → yes.\n\n11: [2,4] → 2 → even → no.\n\n12: [3,5] → 1 → yes.\n\n13: [1,4] → 2 → even → no.\n\n14: [2,5] → 1 → yes.\n\n15: [1,5] → 2 → even → no.\n\nSo beautiful pairs are 2,4,6,7,8,9,10,12,14 → 9 beautiful pairs. Wait, that's 9. But according to the previous count, it's 7. Hmm, there must be a mistake here.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let me recount:\n\nThe intervals are:\n\n1: [1] → 0 → no.\n\n2: [2] → 1 → yes.\n\n3: [3] → 0 → no.\n\n4: [4] → 1 → yes.\n\n5: [5] → 0 → no.\n\n6: [1,2] → blue at 2 → yes.\n\n7: [2,3", "answer": "\\(n^2\\)\n\nJeżeli Jadzia pomaluje każdą liczbę na niebiesko, to para \\((i, j)\\) jest dobra wtedy i tylko wtedy, gdy \\(j - i\\) jest liczbą parzystą.

Hmm, interesting problem. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the question. We need a power of 2 (2^k) where every digit (0 through 9) appears exactly the same number of times in its decimal representation. For example, if k is such that 2^k has, say, 10 digits, each digit 0-9 would need to appear exactly once. But wait, the number of digits in 2^k depends on k. For example, 2^10 is 1024, which has 4 digits. So if we take 2^k and count the digits, that number has to be equal to the number of digits in 2^k. Wait, no. Wait, the digits themselves need to include each digit from 0 to 9 the same number of times. So the total number of digits in 2^k must be divisible by 10, because there are 10 different digits, each appearing the same number of times. So first condition: the number of digits in 2^k must be a multiple of 10. Because if each digit from 0-9 is used equally, then the total number of digits is 10 times the number of times each digit appears. So total digits = 10 * m, where m is the number of times each digit appears. So, for example, if 2^k has 10 digits, each digit must appear exactly once. If it has 20 digits, each digit twice, etc.\n\nSo first, we need to find k such that the number of digits of 2^k is a multiple of 10. Then, the next condition is that each digit from 0-9 appears exactly m times, where 10m = number of digits. So if the number of digits is 10m, then each digit must appear m times. But since 0 is a digit, and 2^k can't start with 0, right? Because 2^k is always a positive integer, so its decimal representation starts with a non-zero digit. Therefore, 0 cannot appear in the first digit. However, 0 can appear in other positions. So 0 must appear m times in the digits, and each of the other digits (1-9) also appear m times. So total digits: 10m, which is correct.\n\nSo first, find k such that the number of digits of 2^k is divisible by 10. Then, check if there's a power of 2 with exactly 10m digits (for some m) where each digit appears exactly m times.\n\nBut how do we approach this? Let's think.\n\nFirst, determine for which exponents k, the number of digits of 2^k is a multiple of 10. The number of digits of 2^k in decimal is given by floor(log10(2^k)) + 1 = floor(k log10(2)) + 1. So, let's denote d_k = floor(k log10(2)) + 1. We need d_k divisible by 10. So we need to solve for k in integers such that floor(k log10(2)) + 1 ≡ 0 mod 10. That is, floor(k log10(2)) ≡ -1 mod 10, which is equivalent to floor(k log10(2)) ≡ 9 mod 10.\n\nSo, we need to find k such that when you multiply k by log10(2) and take the floor, that result is 9 mod 10. So, log10(2) is approximately 0.3010. So, k * 0.3010 ≈ n + 9, where n is an integer. Wait, floor(k log10(2)) = n, so n ≤ k log10(2) < n+1. So, n + 1 ≤ k log10(2) + 1 < n + 2. So, (n + 1)/log10(2) ≤ k < (n + 2)/log10(2). Hmm, but this seems a bit abstract. Maybe we can model this as k ≈ n / log10(2) + 9 / log10(2) mod 1. But log10(2) ≈ 0.3010, so 1/0.3010 ≈ 3.3219. So, perhaps, the fractional part of k log10(2) needs to be such that when multiplied by 10, the fractional part times 10 is just less than the next integer. Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as follows: For each k, compute the number of digits of 2^k, which is floor(k log10(2)) + 1. We need this to be a multiple of 10. So we need floor(k log10(2)) + 1 ≡ 0 mod 10. So floor(k log10(2)) ≡ 9 mod 10. Therefore, k log10(2) must be in [n + 9, n + 10) for some integer n. But log10(2) is irrational, so the fractional parts of k log10(2) are dense in [0,1). So, the values of k log10(2) mod 1 will be dense in [0,1), so there are infinitely many k such that floor(k log10(2)) + 1 is divisible by 10. But I'm not sure if this helps directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find a k such that 2^k has 10m digits, and check if such a number can have all digits 0-9 exactly m times. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use properties of numbers with digits 0-9 equally. Such numbers are called \"pandigital\" numbers, but here it's not exactly that because they don't have to use all digits, but each digit must appear the same number of times. Wait, but in this case, the number must have exactly 10m digits, each digit appearing m times. So, it's a kind of balanced number. For example, 1010...0 with 10 digits, each digit appears twice. But such numbers are rare, but they do exist, like 1020...0, etc. For example, 1023456789 followed by zeros to make it 10 digits. But in our case, it's 2^k, so the number is a power of two, which has specific properties.\n\nSo, perhaps such numbers are rare, and maybe there's no power of two with all digits from 0-9 equally. However, we need to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mathematical reason why such a number cannot exist. For example, 2^k is a multiple of 2, so the last digit is even. Also, 2^k cycles its last digits in a pattern: 2,4,8,6,2,4,8,6,... So, the last digit of 2^k is 2,4,8,6 in a cycle of 4. But how does that relate to the digits in the entire number? Maybe not directly.\n\nAlternatively, think about the number of times each digit appears modulo 10. If we can show that the number of times each digit appears is not congruent modulo 10 for the digits 0-9, then it's impossible. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the fact that the digits of 2^k are uniformly distributed in some sense, but I don't think that's known.\n\nAlternatively, look for existing literature or known results. Wait, perhaps there's a known result about such numbers. For example, numbers that have all digits appearing the same number of times. For example, 111...111 with each digit appearing m times. But such numbers are usually multiples of 111...111, but primes of that form. However, in our case, it's a power of two, which is even, so they can't be of the form 111...111 (except for k=1, which is 2, which is not all digits 1). So maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, think about the fact that 2^k grows exponentially, so the number of digits increases linearly with k. For the number of digits to be a multiple of 10, k must be on the order of log10(10m) ≈ log10(m) / log10(2). So, k is roughly proportional to log(m). So, as m increases, k increases roughly logarithmically. But how does that relate to the distribution of digits?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use modular arithmetic. For example, consider the number 2^k. The sum of its digits modulo 10 must be congruent to 0, since each digit appears m times, so the total sum is 0 mod 10. But 2^k mod 9 is known to be related to the sum of its digits. Wait, 2^k mod 9 cycles every 6: 2,4,8,7,5,1, then repeats. So, if we can relate the sum of digits modulo 9 to 2^k mod 9, maybe. But since the sum of digits mod 9 is equal to the number itself mod 9, then 2^k mod 9 must be equal to the sum of digits mod 9. But the sum of digits is 10m, which is 0 mod 10. So, 10m ≡ 0 mod 9, so m ≡ 0 mod 9/ gcd(10,9) = 9. So m must be a multiple of 9. Therefore, the number of digits must be 10m, where m is a multiple of 9. So the number of digits must be a multiple of 90? Wait, no. Wait, 10m, where m is a multiple of 9. So m = 9t, so 10m = 90t. Therefore, the number of digits must be a multiple of 90. So, the number of digits of 2^k must be divisible by 90. Therefore, we need to find k such that the number of digits of 2^k is 90t for some t. Then, the number of times each digit must appear is 9t times. So, 10 digits, each appearing 9t times, which sums to 90t digits.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding k such that the number of digits of 2^k is 90t, and in that number, each digit 0-9 appears exactly 9t times. Now, 2^k is a number that starts with a 1 or 2, given that 2^1 = 2, 2^2 = 4, 2^3 = 8, 2^4 = 16, etc. So, for k >= 1, 2^k starts with 1 or 2, but after some point, it starts with 1. For example, 2^10 = 1024, which starts with 1, 2^20 = 1,048,576 starts with 1, etc. So, 2^k is either starting with 1 or 2, but after some k, starts with 1. However, the number of digits is floor(k log10(2)) + 1. So, floor(k log10(2)) = 90t -1. So, k log10(2) is in [90t -1, 90t). So, k is approximately (90t -1)/log10(2) ≈ (90t)/0.3010 ≈ 90t * 3.3219 ≈ 299.567t. So, k is roughly 300t. So, for each t, k is around 300t. So, for example, t=1: k≈300, t=2: k≈600, etc.\n\nBut how do we check if such a number exists? For example, take t=1, k≈300. Let's compute 2^300. But 2^10 ≈ 1000, so 2^300 = (2^10)^30 ≈ 1000^30 = 10^90. Wait, 2^10 is approximately 10^3.0103, so 2^300 ≈ 10^(90.309). So, the number of digits is floor(90.309) +1 = 91 digits. Wait, but 90.309 is the exponent. Wait, perhaps my approximation is getting messy. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, instead of trying to compute 2^300, maybe we can use logarithms to find the number of digits. The number of digits of 2^k is floor(k log10(2)) +1. So, for k=300, log10(2)≈0.3010, so 300*0.3010≈90.3. So, floor(90.3)+1=91. So, 2^300 has 91 digits. So, 91 is not a multiple of 10, so that's not 90t. Wait, but 91 is 10*9 +1, so not a multiple of 10. So, 2^300 has 91 digits. So, the next one would be k=330, 330*0.3010≈99.33, floor(99.33)+1=100. So, 2^330 has 100 digits. So, 100 is a multiple of 10. So, k=330 gives 2^330 with 100 digits. So, each digit would need to appear 10 times. Wait, 100 digits, 10 digits, each appearing 10 times. So, 10 times each.\n\nSo, the question is, does there exist k such that 2^k has 100 digits, each digit 0-9 appearing exactly 10 times?", "answer": "Taka liczba **nie** istnieje.  \nZałóżmy, że taka liczba całkowita \\( k \\) istnieje i niech \\( \\ell \\) będzie liczbą wystąpień każdej z cyfr \\( 0, 1, \\ldots, 9 \\) w zapisie dziesiętnym liczby \\( 2^k \\).

Also, it's given that a₄ = a₁ and b₄ = b₁, meaning the quadruples repeat every four terms. \n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. For each i, the next pair (a_{i+1}, b_{i+1}) are the roots of the quadratic equation x² + a_i x + b_i. So, starting from (a₁, b₁), we can find (a₂, b₂) as the roots of x² + a₁ x + b₁ = 0. Then (a₃, b₃) would be the roots of x² + a₂ x + b₂ = 0, and so on, until (a₄, b₄) which is (a₁, b₁) again. \n\nSince we have four equations here, each relating a_{i+1} and b_{i+1} to a_i and b_i, maybe I can express each a and b in terms of previous terms and find a system of equations. But since it's cyclic (a₄ = a₁, b₄ = b₁), the system should close after four steps. \n\nLet me start by writing down the equations for each i from 1 to 3:\n\n1. For i = 1:\n   - a₂ and b₂ are roots of x² + a₁ x + b₁ = 0.\n   - So, a₂ = (-a₁ ± √(a₁² - 4b₁))/2 and b₂ = (-a₁ ∓ √(a₁² - 4b₁))/2.\n\n2. For i = 2:\n   - a₃ and b₃ are roots of x² + a₂ x + b₂ = 0.\n   - So, a₃ = (-a₂ ± √(a₂² - 4b₂))/2 and b₃ = (-a₂ ∓ √(a₂² - 4b₂))/2.\n\n3. For i = 3:\n   - a₄ and b₄ are roots of x² + a₃ x + b₃ = 0.\n   - But since a₄ = a₁ and b₄ = b₁, this gives us a system to solve:\n     - a₁ = (-a₃ ± √(a₃² - 4b₃))/2\n     - b₁ = (-a₃ ∓ √(a₃² - 4b₃))/2\n\nSo we have these four equations. It looks complicated, but maybe if we consider that the coefficients a_i and b_i can be expressed in terms of a₁ and b₁, perhaps we can find a relationship that these variables must satisfy. \n\nAlternatively, since the quadruples repeat every four terms, maybe there's a cyclic pattern or some symmetry. Let me see. Suppose that a₁ = a₄ and b₁ = b₄, so we can write:\n\nFrom i=3: a₁ is a root of x² + a₃ x + b₃ = 0. So:\n\na₁ = (-a₃ ± √(a₃² - 4b₃))/2\n\nSimilarly, b₁ = (-a₃ ∓ √(a₃² - 4b₃))/2\n\nBut since a₁ and b₁ are expressed in terms of a₃ and b₃, which are written in terms of a₂ and b₂, which are in terms of a₁ and b₁. This seems circular. Maybe I can substitute expressions step by step. \n\nLet me try to express each a and b in terms of the previous ones. Let's start with i=1:\n\nFor i=1:\na₂ = (-a₁ + √(a₁² - 4b₁))/2\nb₂ = (-a₁ - √(a₁² - 4b₁))/2\n\nSimilarly, for i=2:\na₃ = (-a₂ + √(a₂² - 4b₂))/2\nb₃ = (-a₂ - √(a₂² - 4b₂))/2\n\nFor i=3:\na₄ = (-a₃ + √(a₃² - 4b₃))/2\nb₄ = (-a₃ - √(a₃² - 4b₃))/2\n\nBut since a₄ = a₁ and b₄ = b₁, we can substitute these expressions into a₁ and b₁. Therefore:\n\na₁ = (-a₃ + √(a₃² - 4b₃))/2\nb₁ = (-a₃ - √(a₃² - 4b₃))/2\n\nNow, these expressions for a₁ and b₁ must be equal to the original a₁ and b₁. Therefore, substituting the expressions for a₃ and b₃ in terms of a₁ and b₁ into the equations above should give equations solely in terms of a₁ and b₁. \n\nThis seems quite involved, but let's proceed step by step. Let's denote A = a₁ and B = b₁. Then, express a₃ and b₃ in terms of A and B, then substitute into the equations for a₁ and b₁.\n\nFirst, let's compute a₂ and b₂ in terms of A and B:\n\na₂ = (-A + √(A² - 4B))/2\nb₂ = (-A - √(A² - 4B))/2\n\nThen, compute a₃ and b₃ in terms of a₂ and b₂:\n\na₃ = (-a₂ + √(a₂² - 4b₂))/2\nb₃ = (-a₂ - √(a₂² - 4b₂))/2\n\nLet me compute a₂² - 4b₂:\n\na₂ = [ -A + sqrt(A² - 4B) ] / 2\n\nSo, a₂² = [ (-A + sqrt(A² - 4B))² ] / 4\n= [ A² - 2A sqrt(A² - 4B) + (A² - 4B) ] / 4\n= [ 2A² - 2A sqrt(A² - 4B) - 4B ] / 4\n= [ A² - 2A sqrt(A² - 4B) - 2B ] / 2\n\nSimilarly, 4b₂ = 4 * [ (-A - sqrt(A² - 4B)) / 2 ]\n= 2*(-A - sqrt(A² - 4B))\n= -2A - 2 sqrt(A² - 4B)\n\nTherefore, a₂² - 4b₂ = [ A² - 2A sqrt(A² - 4B) - 2B ] / 2 - (-2A - 2 sqrt(A² - 4B))\n= [ A² - 2A sqrt(A² - 4B) - 2B ] / 2 + 2A + 2 sqrt(A² - 4B)\n= (A² - 2A sqrt(A² - 4B) - 2B)/2 + 2A + 2 sqrt(A² - 4B)\n= (A²)/2 - A sqrt(A² - 4B) - B + 2A + 2 sqrt(A² - 4B)\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way. Let me compute a₂² - 4b₂ step by step again.\n\nWait, perhaps there's symmetry here. Let me check if a₃ and b₃ can be expressed in terms of a₁ and b₁. Since a₁ and b₁ are the first terms, maybe the entire system is symmetric in some way. Let me assume that after some number of steps, the expressions for a₃ and b₃ will cycle back to a₁ and b₁. \n\nAlternatively, maybe all the a_i and b_i are the same? Let's check if that's possible. Suppose a₁ = a₂ = a₃ = a and b₁ = b₂ = b. Then, for i=1, the equation x² + a x + b = 0 has roots a₂ = a and b₂ = b. Therefore:\n\na² + a a + b = 0 → a² + a² + b = 0 → 2a² + b = 0\nSimilarly, the sum of the roots is -a, but since the roots are a and b, sum is a + b = -a → 2a + b = 0\nProduct of roots is b = a * b\n\nSo from the product: b = a b → b(1 - a) = 0. So either b = 0 or a = 1.\n\nCase 1: b = 0\nThen from 2a² + b = 0 → 2a² = 0 → a = 0\nThen from 2a + b = 0 → 0 + 0 = 0, which holds. Then check product: b = a b → 0 = 0 * 0 = 0, which holds. So a possible solution is a = 0, b = 0.\n\nCase 2: a = 1\nThen from 2a² + b = 0 → 2 + b = 0 → b = -2\nCheck sum: 2*1 + b = 2 + (-2) = 0, which holds.\nProduct: b = 1 * b → -2 = 1*(-2) → -2 = -2, which holds. So another solution is a = 1, b = -2.\n\nSo in the case where all a_i and b_i are equal, we have two solutions: (0,0,0,0,0,0) and (1,1,1,-2,-2,-2). But these are specific cases. The problem asks for all sextuples, so these might not be the only solutions, but they are valid ones.\n\nBut are there others where the a_i and b_i are not all equal? Let's check. Suppose that the a_i and b_i alternate or follow some other pattern. Let me try to see if there's a non-constant solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can express the system of equations in terms of a₁ and b₁. Let's try to find a relationship between a₁ and b₁.\n\nFrom the first step, we have:\n\nFor i=1:\na₂ = (-a₁ + sqrt(a₁² - 4b₁))/2\nb₂ = (-a₁ - sqrt(a₁² - 4b₁))/2\n\nFor i=2:\na₃ = (-a₂ + sqrt(a₂² - 4b₂))/2\nb₃ = (-a₂ - sqrt(a₂² - 4b₂))/2\n\nFor i=3:\na₁ = (-a₃ + sqrt(a₃² - 4b₃))/2\nb₁ = (-a₃ - sqrt(a₃² - 4b₃))/2\n\nSo substituting the expressions for a₂ and b₂ into the equations for a₃ and b₃, then substituting those into the equations for a₁ and b₁, we end up with an equation solely in terms of a₁ and b₁. \n\nLet me attempt to compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, compute a₂ and b₂ in terms of a₁ and b₁. Then compute a₃ and b₃ in terms of a₂ and b₂. Then compute a₁ and b₁ in terms of a₃ and b₃, which are in turn in terms of a₁ and b₁. Therefore, we can write equations for a₁ and b₁ by substituting the expressions.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nFrom i=1:\na₂ = (-a₁ + s1)/2, where s1 = sqrt(a₁² - 4b₁)\nb₂ = (-a₁ - s1)/2\n\nFrom i=2:\na₃ = (-a₂ + s2)/2, where s2 = sqrt(a₂² - 4b₂)\nb₃ = (-a₂ - s2)/2\n\nFrom i=3:\na₁ = (-a₃ + s3)/2, where s3 = sqrt(a₃² - 4b₃)\nb₁ = (-a₃ - s3)/2\n\nNow, substituting a₂ and b₂ into the expressions for a₃ and b₃:\n\na₃ = [ -a₂ + sqrt(a₂² - 4b₂) ] / 2\n= [ (-a₁ + s1)/2 + sqrt( [ (-a₁ + s1)/2 ]² - 4*( (-a₁ - s1)/2 ) ) ] / 2\n\nThis is getting very complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way. Let's try to express all variables in terms of a₁ and b₁.\n\nAlternatively, notice that the system is cyclic with period 4. So maybe we can write equations that relate a₁ and b₁ through the substitutions. Let me attempt that.\n\nFirst, express a₃ and b₃ in terms of a₁ and b₁. Let's denote s1 = sqrt(a₁² - 4b₁). Then:\n\na₂ = (-a₁ + s1)/2\nb₂ = (-a₁ - s1)/2\n\nThen, compute a₃ and b₃:\n\na₃ = [ -a₂ + sqrt(a₂² - 4b₂) ] / 2\n= [ (-a₁ + s1)/2 + sqrt( [ (-a₁ + s1)/2 ]² - 4*(-a₁ - s1)/2 ) ] / 2\n\nLet's compute the term inside the square root:\n\nFirst, square a₂:\n\n[ (-a₁ + s1)/2 ]² = (a₁² - 2a₁ s1 + s1²)/4\n\nThen, multiply by 4:\n\n4*(a₂²) = (a₁² - 2a₁ s1 + s1²)/1\n\nBut a₂² - 4b₂ = (a₂²) - 4b₂. Since b₂ = (-a₁ - s1)/2, 4b₂ = -2a₁ - 2s1.\n\nTherefore, a₂² - 4b₂ = (a₁² - 2a₁ s1 + s1²)/4 - (-2a₁ - 2s1)\n= (a₁² - 2a₁ s1 + s1²)/4 + 2a₁ + 2s1\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator:\n\n= [a₁² - 2a₁ s1 +", "answer": "Korzystając ze wzorów Viete’a warunki dane w zadaniu można zapisać jako układ równań\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases} \na_1 + b_1 = -a_3 \\\\ \na_2 + b_2 = -a_1 \\\\ \na_3 + b_3 = -a_2 \\\\ \na_1 b_1 = b_3 \\\\ \na_2 b_2 = b_1 \\\\ \na_3 b_3 = b_2 \n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nPrzypuśćmy, że któraś z liczb \\(b_1, b_2, b_3\\) jest równa \\(0\\).

Then, each row's sum is a perfect square, and each column's sum is also a perfect square. Moreover, all these sums across the rows and columns must be pairwise different. So, no two sums in the rows can be the same, and the same for the columns, and even some row and column sums can be different from each other.\n\nLet me start with small n and see if I can find a pattern or possible values.\n\nStarting with n=1.

Well, any square is a perfect square. But wait, the problem says \"distinct squares\". So the single number in the grid has to be a square, and since there's only one, that's trivially distinct. So n=1 is possible. The sum is that square, which is a perfect square. The only row and column sum is the same number, but the problem requires the sums to be pairwise different. Wait, hold on. If n=1, there is only one row and one column, each sum is the same as the single number. But the problem says \"the sums of the numbers in each row and in each column... are pairwise different.\" If all sums are the same, then they aren't different. So n=1 is invalid? Wait, the problem says \"the sums of the numbers in each row and in each column... are pairwise different\". So if all the sums are the same, they are not different. Therefore, n=1 is impossible? Wait, but the problem says \"filled with a pair of distinct squares of integers\". Wait, does that mean that the squares themselves are distinct? Yes. So if n=1, the single square must be a square, which is trivial. But the sum is that square, which is a square. The row sum and column sum are the same. But the problem requires all sums to be pairwise different. Therefore, n=1 is impossible. So n=1 is invalid.\n\nWait, but the original problem says \"pairwise different\". So even if all the sums are equal, it's invalid. So n=1 is invalid. Then n=2. Let's check n=2.\n\nFor n=2, we need a 2x2 grid with distinct squares. Each row sum and column sum is a perfect square, and all six sums (two rows, two columns) are pairwise different.\n\nSo let's try to construct such a grid.\n\nLet's denote the grid as:\n\na b\n\nc d\n\nEach of a, b, c, d is a distinct square. The sums a+b, c+d, a+c, b+d must all be perfect squares, and all four row sums and two column sums must be distinct.\n\nLet me choose some small squares. Let's pick 0, 1, 4, 9. These are distinct squares. Let's arrange them in a 2x2 grid.\n\nWait, but 0 is a square, but maybe the problem allows zero? The problem says \"distinct squares of integers\", so 0 is allowed. But then if we have 0 in the grid, the row or column sum could be zero, which is a perfect square. However, the problem doesn't specify that the squares must be positive. So maybe 0 is allowed.\n\nBut maybe the problem expects all squares to be positive? The problem says \"pairwise different\", so zero is allowed, but maybe they want positive squares. Let me check the problem statement again. It says \"distinct squares of integers\", so zero is allowed. So 0 is a square. So perhaps 0 can be used.\n\nBut let's try to start with positive integers. Let's pick 1, 2, 3, 4. Wait, but 1, 4 are squares. Let's see.\n\nSuppose we have:\n\n1 4\n\n3 2\n\nThen the row sums are 1+4=5, 3+2=5. Those are not perfect squares. Hmm. Not good.\n\nAnother try:\n\n3 1\n\n1 6\n\nWait, 6 isn't a square. Not allowed.\n\nHow about:\n\n4 9\n\n1 5\n\nRow sums: 13 and 6. Not squares.\n\nHmm. Maybe 0 is necessary. Let's try:\n\n0 1\n\n2 3\n\nRow sums: 1 and 5. Not squares.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n0 3\n\n4 5\n\nRow sums: 3 and 9. 9 is a square. Column sums: 4 and 8. 4 is a square, but 8 is not. So column sums 4 and 8. 4 and 9. Then row sums 3 and 9. So row sums: 3,9. Column sums:4,8. But 9 is a row sum and 0 is a column sum. Wait, 0 is a square, but the column sum is 0 + 4 = 4, which is a square. So in this case, the row sums are 3 and 9, column sums are 4 and 8. All sums are 3,4,8,9. All different. So this works. So 2x2 grid:\n\nRow 1: 0 and 3 (sum 3)\n\nRow 2: 4 and 5 (sum 9)\n\nColumn 1: 0 and 4 (sum 4)\n\nColumn 2: 3 and 5 (sum 8)\n\nAll sums are 3,4,8,9, which are pairwise different. But wait, the problem says \"pairwise different\" among all the row sums and column sums. So 3,4,8,9 are all different. So this works. But wait, the squares in the grid are 0,3,4,5. These are distinct. So this is a valid 2x2 case. Therefore, n=2 is possible.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"distinct squares of integers\". So 0 is allowed here. But in the original problem statement, maybe they expect positive integers? Hmm. The problem didn't specify, so perhaps 0 is allowed. So n=2 is possible.\n\nNow, n=3. Let's see if we can extend this.\n\nWe need a 3x3 grid with distinct squares, each row and column sum is a perfect square, and all six sums (three rows, three columns) are pairwise different.\n\nThis is more complicated. Let's try constructing such a grid.\n\nFirst, let's consider using 0 as a possible square. Let's try including 0.\n\nLet me try:\n\n0 0 0\n\nBut they have to be distinct squares. So duplicates are not allowed. So all three 0s are invalid.\n\nAlternatively, let's use 0,1,4,9,16. Let's pick five distinct squares. Let's see.\n\nLet me attempt a grid:\n\n0 1 4\n\n5 9 16\n\n3 2 6\n\nRow sums: 0+1+4=5, 5+9+16=30, 3+2+6=11. Not perfect squares.\n\nNo good. Maybe a different arrangement.\n\nLet me try:\n\n0 9 16\n\n4 25 36\n\n1 16 25\n\nRow sums: 0+9+16=25, 4+25+36=65, 1+16+25=42. Not squares.\n\nHmm. Maybe another approach. Let's think about possible squares that can add up to squares. For example, if we have a row with 0,1,3. Sum is 4, which is a square. But 3 is not a square. Wait, no, the numbers in the grid must be distinct squares. So each cell must contain a distinct square. So each cell is a distinct square, but the numbers being added can be any squares, even non-consecutive ones.\n\nWait, but the numbers in the grid are distinct squares, but the sums of rows and columns can be any squares, even if the individual numbers are non-squares? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"pairwise different.\" The sums (which are squares) must be different. So the sums are squares, and all six sums (three rows and three columns) must be different.\n\nSo the key is that the sums of each row and column must be different squares, and each cell in the grid is a distinct square. So the numbers in the grid are distinct squares, but the sums can be squares as long as they are different.\n\nSo, for example, in the 2x2 case, we had 0,3,4,5. The sums were 3,9,4,8. All different squares.\n\nSo maybe for n=3, we can try to include 0,1,4,9,16,25. Let's try to arrange three rows and three columns with distinct squares.\n\nLet me attempt:\n\nRow 1: 0, 9, 16 (sum 25)\n\nRow 2: 4, 5, 16 (sum 25) – but duplicates not allowed. So same issue.\n\nAlternatively, Row 1: 0, 9, 4 (sum 13) – not a square.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. Maybe use perfect square sums. For example, the sum of three distinct squares. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nFor example, 3^2 + 4^2 + 12^2 = 9 + 16 + 144 = 169 = 13^2. So 13^2 is a square. But 12 is not a square. Wait, but the numbers in the grid need to be squares. So the cells must be squares, but their sum must be a square. So the cells can be any squares, but the sum of three distinct squares must be a square.\n\nSo for example, 1, 3, 8: 1+3+8=12, not a square. 1, 8, 15: 1+8+15=24. Not a square. 16, 9, 0: 25=5^2. So 16+9+0=25. So if we have 0,9,16 in a row, their sum is 25. So that works. Similarly, 4, 5, 16: sum 25. So if we use 4,5,16 in another row, their sum is 25.\n\nSo let's try:\n\nRow 1: 0, 9, 16 (sum 25)\n\nRow 2: 4, 5, 16 (sum 25). Wait, duplicate 16. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, Row 2: 4, 5, 9. Sum 18. Not a square.\n\nHmm. Maybe another combination. 0, 16, 9: sum 25. That's the same as Row 1.\n\nAlternatively, 1, 25, 3: sum 30. Not a square. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 4, 16, 9: sum 29. Not a square.\n\nWait, perhaps using three squares that sum to a square. For example, 1, 16, 12: but 12 isn't a square. Wait, but 0 is a square.\n\nAlternatively, 0, 9, 16: sum 25. Then, another row with 4, 16, 9: sum 29. Not a square. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to use 0, 1, 4, 5, 9, 16. Let's see.\n\nSuppose:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1, 16 (sum 17) – not a square.\n\nRow 2: 4, 9, 16 (sum 29) – not a square.\n\nHmm. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, think of known Pythagorean triples. For example, 3,4,5. Squares: 9, 16, 25. Their sum is 50, not a square.\n\nAlternatively, 5,12,13: sum 30. Not a square. 12 is not a square.\n\nAlternatively, 0, 1, 16: sum 17. Not a square.\n\nWait, this is tricky. Maybe for n=3, it's impossible. Let's check if there's a known result or if it's possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps n=3 is possible with some clever arrangement. Let me try again.\n\nSuppose we have three rows, each with three distinct squares, such that each row's sum is a different square, and the three columns also have different sums.\n\nLet me try:\n\nRow 1: 0, 1, 3 (sum 4)\n\nRow 2: 2, 5, 7 (sum 14) – not a square.\n\nRow 3: 9, 16, 25 (sum 50) – not a square.\n\nHmm. Not working.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nRow 1: 0, 9, 16 (sum 25)\n\nRow 2: 4, 5, 16 (sum 25) – duplicates.\n\nWait, maybe 0, 16, 9 in one row, and 16, 9, 0 in another? But duplicates not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, Row 1: 0, 9, 16 (sum 25)\n\nRow 2: 4, 5, 16 (sum 25) – same sum, but numbers are different.\n\nWait, but the problem requires all six sums (three rows, three columns) to be pairwise different. So even if two rows have the same sum, they are not allowed. So all three row sums must be distinct, and all three column sums must be distinct, and all six sums must be distinct.\n\nSo in the 2x2 example, the sums were 3,4,8,9 which are all distinct. So that works.\n\nFor n=3, maybe it's possible to find three different row sums and three different column sums, each pair being distinct.\n\nLet me try to construct an example.\n\nSuppose we have the following grid:\n\nRow 1: 0, 9, 16 (sum 25)\n\nRow 2: 4, 5, 16 (sum 25) – duplicate sum, so invalid.\n\nAlternatively, Row 2: 4, 9, 16 (sum 29) – not a square.\n\n", "answer": "Wszystkie \\(n > 2\\).  \nOczywiście dla \\(n = 1\\) sumy w jednym wierszu i w jednej kolumnie są takie same.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the equation step by step.\n\nFirst, let me rewrite the equation to make sure I have it right. The left side is the square root of the product of x and y. The right side is the sum of √x, √y, √x, and √y. Wait, that's √x twice and √y twice. So combining those terms, the right side simplifies to 2√x + 2√y. So the equation becomes √(xy) = 2√x + 2√y.\n\nHmm, maybe I can simplify this equation by substituting variables. Let me let a = √x and b = √y. Since x and y are non-negative integers, a and b must also be non-negative integers (since the square root of a non-negative integer is either an integer or irrational, but here we need them to be integers). So substituting, x = a² and y = b². Then the equation becomes √(a² * b²) = 2a + 2b. Simplifying the left side, √(a²b²) is |ab|. But since a and b are non-negative integers, |ab| is just ab. So the equation becomes ab = 2a + 2b.\n\nOkay, so now the problem reduces to finding all pairs of non-negative integers (a, b) such that ab = 2a + 2b. Then once we find those pairs, we can square them to get x and y.\n\nSo the key equation is ab = 2a + 2b. Let me rearrange this equation to make it easier to solve. Let's subtract 2a and 2b from both sides to get ab - 2a - 2b = 0. Hmm, maybe factor this equation. Let me try adding 4 to both sides: ab - 2a - 2b + 4 = 4. Then the left side can be factored as (a - 2)(b - 2) = 4. Oh, that's a useful step!\n\nSo (a - 2)(b - 2) = 4. Now, since a and b are non-negative integers, (a - 2) and (b - 2) must be integers as well. However, since x and y are non-negative integers, a and b must be non-negative integers, so (a - 2) and (b - 2) can be negative, zero, or positive integers, but their product must be 4. Wait, but 4 is positive. So the factors (a - 2) and (b - 2) must be both positive or both negative. However, since a and b are non-negative integers, let's see what possible values (a - 2) and (b - 2) can take.\n\nIf (a - 2) and (b - 2) are both positive, then a and b are greater than or equal to 3. If they are both negative, then a and b are less than or equal to 1. But let's check if that's possible.\n\nCase 1: Both (a - 2) and (b - 2) are positive. Then (a - 2) and (b - 2) are positive integers. So their product is 4. The positive integer pairs that multiply to 4 are (1, 4), (2, 2), (4, 1). Therefore, the possible (a, b) pairs would be:\n\nFor (1, 4): a = 2 + 1 = 3, b = 2 + 4 = 6. So (a, b) = (3, 6)\n\nFor (2, 2): a = 2 + 2 = 4, b = 2 + 2 = 4. So (a, b) = (4, 4)\n\nFor (4, 1): a = 2 + 4 = 6, b = 2 + 1 = 3. So (a, b) = (6, 3)\n\nCase 2: Both (a - 2) and (b - 2) are negative. Then their product is positive 4. The negative integer pairs that multiply to 4 are (-1, -4), (-2, -2), (-4, -1). So:\n\nFor (-1, -4): a = 2 + (-1) = 1, b = 2 + (-4) = -2. But b = -2 is not a non-negative integer. So this is invalid.\n\nFor (-2, -2): a = 2 + (-2) = 0, b = 2 + (-2) = 0. So (a, b) = (0, 0). Then x = 0, y = 0.\n\nFor (-4, -1): a = 2 + (-4) = -2, b = 2 + (-1) = 1. Again, a = -2 is invalid since a must be non-negative.\n\nSo in case 2, the only valid solution is (a, b) = (0, 0).\n\nTherefore, the possible (a, b) pairs are (3, 6), (4, 4), (6, 3), and (0, 0). Now, we need to check each of these to ensure that x and y are non-negative integers and that they satisfy the original equation.\n\nFirst, let's check (a, b) = (3, 6). Then x = a² = 9, y = b² = 36. Let's check the original equation: √(xy) = √9*36 = √324 = 18. On the right side: √x + √y + √x + √y = 2√9 + 2√36 = 2*3 + 2*6 = 6 + 12 = 18. So that works.\n\nNext, (a, b) = (4, 4). Then x = 16, y = 16. Original equation: √(16*16) = √256 = 16. Right side: 2√16 + 2√16 = 2*4 + 2*4 = 8 + 8 = 16. That works.\n\nNext, (a, b) = (6, 3). Then x = 36, y = 9. Original equation: √(36*9) = √324 = 18. Right side: 2√36 + 2√9 = 2*6 + 2*3 = 12 + 6 = 18. That works.\n\nFinally, (a, b) = (0, 0). Then x = 0, y = 0. Original equation: √(0*0) = 0. Right side: 2√0 + 2√0 = 0 + 0 = 0. That works.\n\nWait, so all four pairs (3,6), (4,4), (6,3), (0,0) satisfy the equation. But let me check if there are any other possible factor pairs. Earlier, in case 1, we considered positive factors (1,4), (2,2), (4,1). But maybe I missed some. Wait, 4 can be factored as 1*4, 2*2, 4*1, but are there any other positive integer pairs? For example, 4 is 4*1, 2*2, 1*4. So those are the only positive integer factorizations. So in that case, we have all the possibilities covered.\n\nBut let me check another angle. Maybe we can approach the equation ab = 2a + 2b by rearranging terms differently. Let's try subtracting 2a + 2b from both sides: ab - 2a - 2b = 0. Then add 4 to both sides: ab - 2a - 2b + 4 = 4. Then factor the left side as (a - 2)(b - 2) = 4, which is what we did earlier. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider solving for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for b in terms of a: ab = 2a + 2b => ab - 2b = 2a => b(a - 2) = 2a => b = (2a)/(a - 2). Since b must be a non-negative integer, (a - 2) must divide 2a. So (a - 2) divides 2a. Let's see for which a ≥ 0 (since a is a non-negative integer, and x is a non-negative integer, so a is a non-negative integer).\n\nBut since a is a non-negative integer, a - 2 must be a divisor of 2a. Let's consider possible values of a:\n\nIf a = 0: Then b = (2*0)/(0 - 2) = 0 / (-2) = 0. Which is valid, as we saw earlier.\n\nIf a = 1: Then b = (2*1)/(1 - 2) = 2 / (-1) = -2. Not a non-negative integer. So invalid.\n\nIf a = 2: Then denominator is zero, which is undefined. So a cannot be 2.\n\nIf a ≥ 3: Then a - 2 is a positive integer, and we need (a - 2) divides 2a. Let's write 2a = k(a - 2), where k is a positive integer. Then 2a = ka - 2k => (2 - k)a = -2k. Then a = (-2k)/(2 - k). Since a must be a non-negative integer, let's see possible k:\n\nFor k = 1: a = (-2*1)/(2 - 1) = -2/1 = -2. Not valid.\n\nFor k = 2: a = (-2*2)/(2 - 2) = (-4)/0. Undefined.\n\nFor k = 3: a = (-2*3)/(2 - 3) = (-6)/(-1) = 6. So a = 6. Then b = 2*6/(6 - 2) = 12/4 = 3. Which is the (6, 3) pair, which we already have.\n\nFor k = 4: a = (-2*4)/(2 - 4) = (-8)/(-2) = 4. Then b = 2*4/(4 - 2) = 8/2 = 4. So (4, 4), which we have.\n\nFor k = 5: a = (-2*5)/(2 - 5) = (-10)/(-3) = 10/3 ≈ 3.333. Not integer.\n\nFor k = 6: a = (-12)/(2 - 6) = (-12)/(-4) = 3. Then b = 2*3/(3 - 2) = 6/1 = 6. Which is the (3, 6) pair we found earlier.\n\nSo, for a ≥ 3, the possible k values that give integer a are 3 and 4, leading to a = 6, b = 3 and a = 4, b = 4. For k ≥ 5, we get non-integer a. So only (4,4) and (6,3) for a ≥ 3.\n\nAdditionally, we already considered the case when a = 0, leading to b = 0. So combining all these, the possible (a, b) pairs are (0, 0), (3, 6), (4, 4), (6, 3). Therefore, converting back to x and y:\n\nFor (0, 0): x = 0, y = 0.\n\nFor (3, 6): x = 9, y = 36.\n\nFor (4, 4): x = 16, y = 16.\n\nFor (6, 3): x = 36, y = 9.\n\nSo all possible solutions are (0,0), (9,36), (16,16), (36,9). Wait, but let me check if (0,0) is a valid solution. The original equation: √(0*0) = 0. On the right side: √0 + √0 + √0 + √0 = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. So yes, 0=0, which is valid. But the problem says \"non-negative integers\". So 0 is allowed. However, sometimes in some contexts, non-negative integers might refer to strictly positive integers, but the problem says \"non-negative\", so 0 is included.\n\nSo the solutions are (0,0), (9,36), (16,16), (36,9). But wait, (36,9) is same as (9,36) if we consider ordered pairs, but since the problem says \"pairs of non-negative integers\", ordered pairs are considered different if the components are different. But in the original problem statement, it's not specified whether ordered pairs are considered different or if (x,y) and (y,x) are the same. But in the equation, since x and y are involved multiplicatively, swapping x and y would give the same equation, but in terms of ordered pairs, (x,y) and (y,x) are different unless x=y.\n\nBut let's check if (9,36) and (36,9) are distinct solutions. Let's plug them into the original equation:\n\nFor (9,36): √(9*36) = √324 = 18. On the right side: √9 + √36 + √9 + √36 = 3 + 6 + 3 + 6 = 18. So yes, both (9,36) and (36,9) work. Similarly, (16,16) is symmetric. So they are distinct ordered pairs.\n\nBut in the problem statement, when it says \"pairs of non-negative integers (x, y)\", they might be considering ordered pairs where x and y can be in any order. However, sometimes problems might consider (a,b) and (b,a) as the same pair. But since the problem uses (x,y) as the variables, and the equation is symmetric in x and y, then (x,y) and (y,x) are considered distinct unless x=y.

Each equation is similar in structure, with a quadratic term, a linear term, and a cross term with another variable. Maybe if I can find some symmetry or substitute variables, it would help.\n\nFirst, let me see if there are any obvious solutions. Sometimes plugging in simple values like x = y = z can work. Let's try x = y = z. Let's substitute into equation (1):\n\nx²x + 2 = x + 2x²\n\nSimplify left side: x³ + 2 = x + 2x²\n\nBring all terms to left: x³ - 2x² + x + 2 = 0\n\nLet me try x = -1: (-1)^3 - 2*(-1)^2 + (-1) + 2 = -1 - 2 -1 + 2 = -2 ≠ 0\n\nx = 1: 1 - 2 + 1 + 2 = 2 ≠ 0\n\nx = 2: 8 - 8 + 2 + 2 = 4 ≠ 0\n\nx = 0: 0 - 0 + 0 + 2 = 2 ≠ 0\n\nHmm, no obvious roots here. Maybe x = y = z = 1? Let's check:\n\nEquation (1): 1²*1 + 2 = 1 + 2*1*1 → 1 + 2 = 1 + 2 → 3 = 3. Okay, that works.\n\nEquation (2): same as (1), so also works.\n\nEquation (3): same, so it's a solution. So (1,1,1) is a solution.\n\nAre there others? Maybe. Let's see if there are other solutions where variables aren't all equal. Let's check if variables can be zero. Suppose x = 0. Then equation (1) becomes 0 + 2 = 0 + 0 → 2 = 0, which is false. So x can't be zero. Similarly, y and z can't be zero. So all variables must be non-zero.\n\nMaybe we can manipulate the equations. Let's try to express each variable in terms of others. For example, from equation (1):\n\nx²y + 2 = x + 2yz\n\nLet me rearrange this:\n\nx²y - x = 2yz - 2\n\nFactor left side: x(xy - 1)\n\nFactor right side: 2(yz - 1)\n\nSo x(xy - 1) = 2(yz - 1) → x = [2(yz - 1)] / (xy - 1)\n\nHmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe similar for other equations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract equations to find relationships. Let's subtract equation (1) from equation (2):\n\n(y²z + 2) - (x²y + 2) = (y + 2zx) - (x + 2yz)\n\nSimplify left side: y²z - x²y = y - x + 2zx - 2yz\n\nFactor left side: yz(y) - xy(x) = yz(y) - xy(x) = yz(y - x) - xy(x - y) = (y - x)(yz + xy)\n\nWait, let's check that:\n\nWait, y²z - x²y = y z (y) - x y (x) = y z (y - x) - x y (x - y) = y z (y - x) + x y (y - x) = (y - x)(y z + x y)\n\nWait, maybe another way:\n\ny²z - x²y = y z (y) - x y (x) = y z (y) - x y (x) = y z y - x y x = y² z - x² y\n\nAlternatively, factor y from first two terms and x from last two:\n\ny(z y - x²) + 2 - 2 = y(z y - x²) = y(z y - x²)\n\nWait, maybe that's not helpful. Let's see:\n\nOriginal subtraction:\n\ny²z - x²y = y - x + 2zx - 2yz\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\ny²z - x²y - y + x - 2zx + 2yz = 0\n\nLet me factor terms:\n\ny²z + 2yz - x²y - 2zx + x - y = 0\n\nFactor y from first three terms: y(z y + 2z - x²) + x - y = 0\n\nHmm, not sure. Maybe rearrange terms:\n\ny²z + 2yz - x²y - 2zx + x - y = 0\n\nFactor y from first three terms:\n\ny(z y + 2z - x²) + x - y = 0\n\nNot helpful. Maybe this approach is too messy. Let me try another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe divide equations. Let's see:\n\nTake equation (1): x²y + 2 = x + 2yz → x²y - 2yz = x - 2\n\nSimilarly, equation (2): y²z - 2zx = y - 2\n\nEquation (3): z²x - 2xy = z - 2\n\nSo each equation can be written as:\n\nx²y - 2yz = x - 2 → y(x² - 2z) = x - 2 → y = (x - 2)/(x² - 2z) [assuming x² - 2z ≠ 0]\n\nSimilarly, from equation (2):\n\ny²z - 2zx = y - 2 → z(y² - 2x) = y - 2 → z = (y - 2)/(y² - 2x)\n\nFrom equation (3):\n\nz²x - 2xy = z - 2 → x(z² - 2y) = z - 2 → x = (z - 2)/(z² - 2y)\n\nHmm, so we have expressions for y, z, x in terms of each other. Let me see if substituting these into each other would help.\n\nStart with y = (x - 2)/(x² - 2z). Then substitute z from equation (2): z = (y - 2)/(y² - 2x). So:\n\ny = [x - 2] / [x² - 2*(y - 2)/(y² - 2x)]\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe we can substitute z into equation (3). Wait, equation (3) gives x in terms of z and y. Alternatively, maybe substitute z from equation (2) into equation (3).\n\nWait, equation (3) is z²x - 2xy = z - 2. Let's express z from equation (2):\n\nz = (y - 2)/(y² - 2x)\n\nPlug this into equation (3):\n\n[( (y - 2)/(y² - 2x) )² * x] - 2xy = ( (y - 2)/(y² - 2x) ) - 2\n\nThis seems very complicated, but let's try to write it step by step.\n\nLet me denote denominator as D = y² - 2x. Then:\n\nz = (y - 2)/D\n\nEquation (3):\n\n(z² x) - 2xy = z - 2\n\nSubstitute z:\n\n[ ( (y - 2)/D )² * x ] - 2xy = (y - 2)/D - 2\n\nMultiply through by D² to eliminate denominators:\n\n[ (y - 2)² x - 2xy D² ] = (y - 2) D - 2 D²\n\nBut this might not be helpful. Alternatively, multiply entire equation by D:\n\nLeft side: ( (y - 2)^2 x / D ) * D - 2xy * D = (y - 2)^2 x - 2x y D\n\nRight side: (y - 2) - 2 D\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n(y - 2)^2 x - 2x y D = (y - 2) - 2 D\n\nBut D = y² - 2x, so substitute back:\n\n(y - 2)^2 x - 2x y (y² - 2x) = (y - 2) - 2(y² - 2x)\n\nExpand left side:\n\nx(y² - 4y + 4) - 2x y (y² - 2x) = x y² - 4x y + 4x - 2x y³ + 4x² y\n\nRight side:\n\ny - 2 - 2y² + 4x\n\nSo left side: x y² - 4x y + 4x - 2x y³ + 4x² y\n\nRight side: -2y² + y - 2 + 4x\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nx y² - 4x y + 4x - 2x y³ + 4x² y + 2y² - y + 2 - 4x = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n-2x y³ + x y² + 4x² y - 4x y + 4x + 2y² - y + 2 = 0\n\nThis is getting way too complicated. Maybe this approach isn't the best. Let me think of another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that two variables are equal, say x = y. Then try to see if that leads to a solution.\n\nLet’s suppose x = y. Then equation (1) becomes:\n\nx²x + 2 = x + 2xz → x³ + 2 = x + 2xz\n\nEquation (2) becomes the same as (1) since x = y, so:\n\nx²z + 2 = x + 2xz\n\nEquation (3) becomes:\n\nz²x + 2 = z + 2x²\n\nSo now we have two equations:\n\n1. x³ + 2 = x + 2xz\n\n2. x²z + 2 = x + 2xz\n\nSubtract equation 2 from equation 1:\n\nx³ + 2 - (x²z + 2) = x + 2xz - (x + 2xz)\n\nSimplify:\n\nx³ - x²z = 0 → x²(x - z) = 0\n\nSo either x² = 0 → x = 0, but x can't be zero as we saw earlier, or x - z = 0 → x = z\n\nSo if x = y = z, then the solution we found earlier, x = y = z = 1, is a solution. So that's consistent.\n\nBut are there other solutions where x = y ≠ z?\n\nIf x = y ≠ z, then from equation (1):\n\nx²x + 2 = x + 2xz → x³ + 2 = x + 2xz\n\nFrom equation (3):\n\nz²x + 2 = z + 2x²\n\nSo we have:\n\nx³ + 2 = x + 2xz → equation (1a)\n\nz²x + 2 = z + 2x² → equation (3a)\n\nLet me try to express z from equation (1a):\n\nFrom equation (1a): x³ + 2 - x = 2xz → z = (x³ + 2 - x)/(2x) = [x³ - x + 2]/(2x)\n\nSimilarly, from equation (3a): z²x + 2 = z + 2x² → z²x - z + 2x² - 2 = 0\n\nLet me substitute z = [x³ - x + 2]/(2x) into equation (3a):\n\nFirst compute z:\n\nz = (x³ - x + 2)/(2x)\n\nThen z²x = [ (x³ - x + 2)^2 ] / (4x²) * x = (x³ - x + 2)^2 / (4x)\n\nSo equation (3a) becomes:\n\n(x³ - x + 2)^2 / (4x) + 2 = (x³ - x + 2)/(2x) + 2x²\n\nMultiply both sides by 4x to eliminate denominators:\n\n(x³ - x + 2)^2 + 8x = 2(x³ - x + 2) + 8x³\n\nExpand left side:\n\nLet me compute (x³ - x + 2)^2:\n\n= x^6 - 2x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 - 4x + 4\n\nWait, let me do it step by step:\n\n(a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc\n\nHere, a = x³, b = -x, c = 2\n\nSo:\n\n(x³)^2 + (-x)^2 + (2)^2 + 2*(x³*(-x) + x³*2 + (-x)*2)\n\n= x^6 + x² + 4 + 2*(-x^4 + 2x³ - 2x)\n\n= x^6 + x² + 4 - 2x^4 + 4x³ - 4x\n\nSo left side becomes:\n\nx^6 + x² + 4 - 2x^4 + 4x³ - 4x + 8x = x^6 - 2x^4 + 4x³ + x² + 4x + 4\n\nRight side: 2(x³ - x + 2) + 8x³ = 2x³ - 2x + 4 + 8x³ = 10x³ - 2x + 4\n\nSet left = right:\n\nx^6 - 2x^4 + 4x³ + x² + 4x + 4 = 10x³ - 2x + 4\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nx^6 - 2x^4 + 4x³ + x² + 4x + 4 - 10x³ + 2x - 4 = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\nx^6 - 2x^4 -6x³ + x² + 6x = 0\n\nFactor:\n\nx(x^5 - 2x^3 -6x² + x + 6) = 0\n\nSo either x = 0, which is impossible, or solve x^5 -", "answer": "\bJedynymi trójkami x, y, z spełniającymi dane równania są: (-1, -1, -1), (1, 1, 1), (2, 2, 2)."}

Hmm, functional equations can be tricky, but let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall that functional equations often require substituting specific values for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) to simplify the equation and find properties of the function \\( f \\). Maybe I can try some standard substitutions like setting \\( x = 0 \\) or \\( y = 0 \\), or \\( x = y \\), to see if that helps.\n\nLet me start by setting \\( x = 0 \\). Then the equation becomes:\n\\[\nf(f(0) + f(y)) + c \\cdot 0 \\cdot y = f(0 + y)\n\\]\nSimplifying, that's:\n\\[\nf(f(0) + f(y)) = f(y)\n\\]\nHmm, this is interesting. So, \\( f(f(0) + f(y)) = f(y) \\) for all \\( y \\). Let's denote \\( a = f(0) \\). Then, the equation becomes \\( f(a + f(y)) = f(y) \\). \n\nNow, what does this tell us about \\( f \\)? If \\( a + f(y) \\) is in the domain of \\( f \\), which it is, then \\( f \\) evaluated at \\( a + f(y) \\) equals \\( f(y) \\). This suggests that \\( f \\) is constant on the set \\( \\{ a + f(y) \\mid y \\in \\mathbb{R} \\} \\). But unless \\( a + f(y) \\) is constant for all \\( y \\), which would mean \\( f(y) \\) is constant, but if \\( f \\) is constant, let's check that possibility.\n\nSuppose \\( f \\) is a constant function, say \\( f(x) = k \\) for some constant \\( k \\in \\mathbb{R} \\). Then substituting into the original equation:\n\\[\nf(f(x) + f(y)) + cxy = f(x + y)\n\\]\nSince \\( f(x) = f(y) = k \\), this becomes:\n\\[\nf(k + k) + cxy = k\n\\]\nWhich simplifies to:\n\\[\nf(2k) + cxy = k\n\\]\nBut \\( f(2k) = k \\) (since \\( f \\) is constant), so:\n\\[\nk + cxy = k \\implies cxy = 0\n\\]\nThis must hold for all \\( x, y \\in \\mathbb{R} \\). The only way this can be true is if \\( c = 0 \\), but then \\( 0 = 0 \\), which is okay. Wait, but in this case, if \\( c = 0 \\), then the equation is satisfied for all \\( x, y \\), regardless of \\( f \\). But if \\( f \\) is constant, then \\( c \\) has to be 0. So that suggests that \\( c = 0 \\) is a possible solution. But is that the only one?\n\nWait, but maybe \\( f \\) is not constant. Let's see. If \\( f \\) is not constant, then \\( f(a + f(y)) = f(y) \\) must hold for all \\( y \\). Let me think. If \\( a + f(y) \\) is a root of \\( f \\), i.e., \\( f(r) = f(y) \\) whenever \\( r = a + f(y) \\), then perhaps \\( f \\) is periodic? But over the reals, periodic functions might not behave well with the equation \\( f(f(x) + f(y)) + cxy = f(x + y) \\). Let me check if \\( f \\) can be linear.\n\nSuppose \\( f \\) is a linear function. Let's assume \\( f(x) = mx + b \\). Then let's substitute into the original equation.\n\nCompute \\( f(f(x) + f(y)) \\):\nFirst, \\( f(x) + f(y) = m x + b + m y + b = m(x + y) + 2b \\). Then:\n\\[\nf(f(x) + f(y)) = m(m(x + y) + 2b) + b = m^2(x + y) + 2mb + b\n\\]\nOn the other hand, the right-hand side is \\( f(x + y) = m(x + y) + b \\).\n\nSo substituting into the equation:\n\\[\nm^2(x + y) + 2mb + b + cxy = m(x + y) + b\n\\]\nSimplify the left-hand side:\n\\[\nm^2(x + y) + 2mb + b + cxy\n\\]\nSubtract \\( m(x + y) + b \\) from both sides:\n\\[\n(m^2 - m)(x + y) + 2mb + cxy = 0\n\\]\nFor this to hold for all \\( x, y \\in \\mathbb{R} \\), the coefficients of corresponding terms must be zero.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of \\( xy \\) is \\( c \\). So \\( c = 0 \\).\n\nNext, the coefficients of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) must be zero. But looking at the left-hand side, the coefficients of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are both \\( (m^2 - m) \\). Therefore, \\( m^2 - m = 0 \\). So \\( m(m - 1) = 0 \\), which gives \\( m = 0 \\) or \\( m = 1 \\).\n\nIf \\( m = 0 \\), then the function is \\( f(x) = 0 \\cdot x + b = b \\). Let's check if this works. If \\( f \\) is constant, as before, then substituting into the original equation gives \\( cxy = 0 \\), which requires \\( c = 0 \\). So \\( m = 0 \\) gives \\( c = 0 \\).\n\nIf \\( m = 1 \\), then \\( f(x) = x + b \\). Let's check this. Substitute into the original equation:\n\nLeft-hand side:\n\\( f(f(x) + f(y)) + cxy = f(x + b + y + b) + cxy = f(x + y + 2b) + cxy = (x + y + 2b) + cxy \\)\n\nRight-hand side:\n\\( f(x + y) = (x + y) + b \\)\n\nSet them equal:\n\\[\n(x + y + 2b) + cxy = (x + y) + b\n\\]\nSimplify:\n\\[\ncxy + 2b = b \\implies cxy + b = 0\n\\]\nBut this must hold for all \\( x, y \\). The only way this can be true is if \\( c = 0 \\) and \\( b = 0 \\). So \\( m = 1 \\) gives \\( c = 0 \\).\n\nTherefore, the only linear solution is when \\( c = 0 \\), and \\( f \\) is a constant function (if \\( m = 0 \\), then \\( f \\) is constant, but if \\( m = 1 \\), then \\( b = 0 \\), so \\( f(x) = x \\)). Wait, hold on. If \\( m = 1 \\), \\( b = 0 \\), so \\( f(x) = x \\). Let me check if \\( f(x) = x \\) works when \\( c = 0 \\):\n\nLeft-hand side: \\( f(f(x) + f(y)) + 0 \\cdot xy = f(x + y) + 0 = x + y \\)\n\nRight-hand side: \\( f(x + y) = x + y \\)\n\nYes, that works. So \\( f(x) = x \\) is a solution when \\( c = 0 \\), and the constant function \\( f(x) = k \\) with \\( k = 0 \\) is also a solution because plugging into the original equation gives \\( 0 + 0 = 0 \\), which is true. Wait, but earlier when I considered constant functions, I assumed \\( f \\) is constant, but if \\( f \\) is constant \\( k \\), then substituting into the original equation gives \\( k + 0 = k \\), which is always true regardless of \\( k \\). Wait, hold on, this contradicts my previous conclusion.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If \\( f \\) is a constant function \\( k \\), then substituting into the original equation:\n\nLeft-hand side: \\( f(f(x) + f(y)) + cxy = f(k + k) + cxy = f(2k) + cxy = k + cxy \\)\n\nRight-hand side: \\( f(x + y) = k \\)\n\nThus, \\( k + cxy = k \\implies cxy = 0 \\). Which must hold for all \\( x, y \\). Hence, \\( c = 0 \\). So even though constant functions are solutions, they only work when \\( c = 0 \\). Therefore, the constant function \\( f(x) = 0 \\) is a solution when \\( c = 0 \\), and similarly, \\( f(x) = k \\) is a solution only when \\( c = 0 \\).\n\nSo, from linear functions, we saw that \\( c = 0 \\) is required. But maybe there are non-linear solutions for some other \\( c \\)?\n\nTo check that, let me suppose that \\( c \\neq 0 \\). Then, perhaps there's a non-constant function \\( f \\) that satisfies the equation. Let me try to see what properties the function must have.\n\nFirst, from substituting \\( x = 0 \\), we had \\( f(f(0) + f(y)) = f(y) \\). Let me denote \\( a = f(0) \\). Then, \\( f(a + f(y)) = f(y) \\) for all \\( y \\). Similarly, if I set \\( y = 0 \\), then the original equation becomes \\( f(f(x) + f(0)) + c x \\cdot 0 = f(x + 0) \\), so \\( f(f(x) + a) = f(x) \\).\n\nWait, so we have two equations:\n1. \\( f(a + f(y)) = f(y) \\) for all \\( y \\).\n2. \\( f(f(x) + a) = f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\).\n\nThese equations seem to be similar. Let me see if I can combine them.\n\nFrom equation 1: \\( f(a + f(y)) = f(y) \\). Let me denote \\( z = f(y) \\). Then, equation 1 becomes \\( f(a + z) = z \\).\n\nSimilarly, equation 2: \\( f(f(x) + a) = f(x) \\). Let \\( w = f(x) \\), so equation 2 becomes \\( f(w + a) = w \\).\n\nSo both equations state that \\( f(a + z) = z \\) and \\( f(w + a) = w \\), where \\( z = f(y) \\) and \\( w = f(x) \\). Therefore, combining these, since \\( z \\) and \\( w \\) can be any real numbers (as \\( f \\) maps \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) to \\( \\mathbb{R} \\)), this suggests that for all real numbers \\( t \\), \\( f(a + t) = t \\). Wait, is that true?\n\nIf \\( t = a + z \\), then \\( z = t - a \\), so \\( f(t) = t - a \\). But \\( z = f(y) \\), so \\( t = a + z = a + f(y) \\). Therefore, for any \\( t \\), we can write \\( t = a + f(y) \\), which implies that \\( f(t) = t - a \\). Therefore, \\( f(t) = t - a \\) for all \\( t \\in \\mathbb{R} \\). \n\nWait, that's a crucial conclusion. So if \\( f(t) = t - a \\) for all \\( t \\), then \\( a \\) is a constant. Let's check if this function satisfies the original functional equation.\n\nSuppose \\( f(t) = t - a \\). Let's substitute into the original equation:\n\nLeft-hand side: \\( f(f(x) + f(y)) + cxy \\)\nCompute \\( f(x) = x - a \\), so \\( f(x) + f(y) = (x - a) + (y - a) = x + y - 2a \\).\nThen \\( f(f(x) + f(y)) = f(x + y - 2a) = (x + y - 2a) - a = x + y - 3a \\).\nThus, left-hand side is \\( x + y - 3a + cxy \\).\n\nRight-hand side: \\( f(x + y) = (x + y) - a \\).\n\nSet them equal:\n\\[\nx + y - 3a + cxy = x + y - a\n\\]\nSimplify:\n\\[\n-3a + cxy = -a \\implies cxy = 2a\n\\]\nBut this must hold for all \\( x, y \\in \\mathbb{R} \\). The only way this can be true is if \\( c = 0 \\) and \\( a = 0 \\). Because if \\( c \\neq 0 \\), then the left-hand side is a non-zero multiple of \\( xy \\), but the right-hand side is a constant. The only solution is \\( c = 0 \\) and \\( a = 0 \\). Therefore, \\( f(t) = t - 0 = t \\). So the only function \\( f \\) that satisfies the original equation is \\( f(x) = x \\), and this works only when \\( c = 0 \\).\n\nWait, but earlier, when I considered linear functions, setting \\( f(x) = x + b \\), we found that \\( b = 0 \\) gives a solution, but \\( c = 0 \\). So combining these results, the only solution is \\( c = 0 \\), and the function \\( f(x) = x \\). But let me check if there are other functions that might work for some \\( c \\neq 0 \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a non-linear function for some \\( c \\). Let's suppose that \\( c \\neq 0 \\). Let's try to see if such a function can exist.\n\nFrom the earlier substitution \\( x = 0 \\), we have \\( f(a + f(y)) = f(y) \\). If \\( f \\) is not linear, maybe there's some periodicity or other behavior.\n\nSuppose that \\( f \\) is constant function \\( f(x) = k \\). Then, as we saw earlier, this requires \\( c = 0 \\).

Hmm, so we need to find such numbers a, b, c where two of these fractions are the same, and the third one is different. \n\nFirst, let me understand the structure of each fraction.

Maybe if I can find a relationship between a, b, and c that would make two of them equal. Let's start by assuming that two of the fractions are equal and see if we can derive some equations.\n\nLet me consider the first and the second fraction. Suppose:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a + b}{a^2 + ab + b^2} = \\frac{b + c}{b^2 + bc + c^2}\n\\]\n\nIf this equality holds, then maybe we can find a relationship between a, b, and c. Let's cross-multiply to eliminate the denominators:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)(b^2 + bc + c^2) = (b + c)(a^2 + ab + b^2)\n\\]\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft side: \\(a(b^2 + bc + c^2) + b(b^2 + bc + c^2)\\)\n= \\(ab^2 + abc + ac^2 + b^3 + b^2c + bc^2\\)\n\nRight side: \\(b(a^2 + ab + b^2) + c(a^2 + ab + b^2)\\)\n= \\(a^2b + ab^2 + b^3 + a^2c + abc + b c^2\\)\n\nNow, let's set left side equal to right side:\n\n\\(ab^2 + abc + ac^2 + b^3 + b^2c + bc^2 = a^2b + ab^2 + b^3 + a^2c + abc + bc^2\\)\n\nSubtracting the common terms from both sides:\n\nLeft side: \\(abc + ac^2 + b^2c + bc^2\\)\n\nRight side: \\(a^2b + a^2c\\)\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\\(abc + ac^2 + b^2c + bc^2 = a^2b + a^2c\\)\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe factor terms:\n\nLeft side: c(a + b) + b^2c + bc^2\n\nRight side: a^2(b + c)\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nLeft side: c(a + b) + bc(b + c) = c(a + b) + bc(b + c)\n\nRight side: a^2(b + c)\n\nSo, we can factor (b + c) from the right side:\n\nLeft side: c(a + b) + bc(b + c) = (a + b)c + bc(b + c) = (a + b)c + b c (b + c)\n\nWait, maybe factor differently. Let me group terms:\n\nLeft side: c(a + b) + bc(b + c)\n\nRight side: a^2(b + c) = a^2(b + c)\n\nSo, we can write:\n\nc(a + b) + bc(b + c) = a^2(b + c)\n\nIf (b + c) ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by (b + c):\n\nc(a + b) + bc = a^2\n\nLet's expand the left side:\n\nca + cb + bc = a^2\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nca + 2bc = a^2\n\nFactor out c:\n\nc(a + 2b) = a^2\n\nSo, c = a^2 / (a + 2b)\n\nHmm, that's a relationship between c, a, and b. Now, since we assumed that the first two fractions are equal, we can use this to relate c to a and b. Then, perhaps using the third fraction, we can find a relationship between b and a, or something else.\n\nBut we also need to ensure that the third fraction is different. So, the third fraction is \\(\\frac{c + a}{c^2 + ca + a^2}\\), which should not equal the other two. Let's denote the two equal fractions as F, so:\n\nF = \\(\\frac{a + b}{a^2 + ab + b^2}\\) = \\(\\frac{b + c}{b^2 + bc + c^2}\\)\n\nAnd the third fraction is \\(\\frac{c + a}{c^2 + ca + a^2}\\), which is different.\n\nSo, perhaps substitute c = a^2 / (a + 2b) into this third fraction and check if it's different.\n\nLet me proceed step by step. Let's first express c in terms of a and b: c = a² / (a + 2b). Now, let's substitute this into the third fraction:\n\nThird fraction numerator: c + a = a²/(a + 2b) + a = a²/(a + 2b) + a(a + 2b)/(a + 2b) = [a² + a(a + 2b)] / (a + 2b) = [a² + a² + 2ab] / (a + 2b) = (2a² + 2ab) / (a + 2b) = 2a(a + b) / (a + 2b)\n\nDenominator: c² + ca + a². Let's compute each term:\n\nc² = [a² / (a + 2b)]² = a^4 / (a + 2b)^2\n\nca = a * [a² / (a + 2b)] = a^3 / (a + 2b)\n\na² is just a².\n\nSo, denominator = a^4 / (a + 2b)^2 + a^3 / (a + 2b) + a²\n\nLet's factor out a^2 / (a + 2b)^2:\n\nDenominator = a^2 [ a² / (a + 2b)^2 + a / (a + 2b) + 1 ]\n\nLet me compute each term inside the brackets:\n\nFirst term: a² / (a + 2b)^2\n\nSecond term: a / (a + 2b) = [a(a + 2b)] / (a + 2b)^2 = [a² + 2ab] / (a + 2b)^2\n\nThird term: 1 = (a + 2b)^2 / (a + 2b)^2\n\nSo, adding them together:\n\n[ a² + a² + 2ab + (a + 2b)^2 ] / (a + 2b)^2\n\nCompute numerator:\n\na² + a² + 2ab + (a² + 4ab + 4b²) = 2a² + 2ab + a² + 4ab + 4b² = 3a² + 6ab + 4b²\n\nSo, denominator = a² [ (3a² + 6ab + 4b²) / (a + 2b)^2 ) ] = a²(3a² + 6ab + 4b²) / (a + 2b)^2\n\nTherefore, the third fraction is:\n\nNumerator: 2a(a + b) / (a + 2b)\n\nDenominator: a²(3a² + 6ab + 4b²) / (a + 2b)^2\n\nSo, the third fraction is:\n\n[2a(a + b)/(a + 2b)] / [a²(3a² + 6ab + 4b²)/(a + 2b)^2] = [2a(a + b)/(a + 2b)] * [(a + 2b)^2 / (a²(3a² + 6ab + 4b²))]\n\nSimplify:\n\n= 2a(a + b)(a + 2b) / (a²(3a² + 6ab + 4b²))\n\nCancel an a from numerator and denominator:\n\n= 2(a + b)(a + 2b) / [a(3a² + 6ab + 4b²)]\n\nHmm, so the third fraction is 2(a + b)(a + 2b) divided by [a(3a² + 6ab + 4b²)].\n\nNow, we need to check if this is equal to F, which is (a + b)/(a² + ab + b²). So, let's set them equal:\n\n2(a + b)(a + 2b) / [a(3a² + 6ab + 4b²)] = (a + b)/(a² + ab + b²)\n\nWe can cancel (a + b) from both sides, assuming a + b ≠ 0. So, if a + b ≠ 0, then:\n\n2(a + 2b) / [a(3a² + 6ab + 4b²)] = 1/(a² + ab + b²)\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n2(a + 2b)(a² + ab + b²) = a(3a² + 6ab + 4b²)\n\nExpand the left side:\n\nFirst, multiply 2 with (a + 2b):\n\n2a(a² + ab + b²) + 4b(a² + ab + b²)\n\n= 2a³ + 2a²b + 2ab² + 4a²b + 4ab² + 4b³\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2a³ + (2a²b + 4a²b) + (2ab² + 4ab²) + 4b³\n\n= 2a³ + 6a²b + 6ab² + 4b³\n\nRight side: a(3a² + 6ab + 4b²) = 3a³ + 6a²b + 4ab²\n\nSet left side equal to right side:\n\n2a³ + 6a²b + 6ab² + 4b³ = 3a³ + 6a²b + 4ab²\n\nSubtract right side from left side:\n\n(2a³ - 3a³) + (6a²b - 6a²b) + (6ab² - 4ab²) + 4b³ = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n- a³ + 0 + 2ab² + 4b³ = 0\n\nSo:\n\n- a³ + 2ab² + 4b³ = 0\n\nLet me write this as:\n\na³ = 2ab² + 4b³\n\nDivide both sides by b³ (assuming b ≠ 0):\n\n(a/b)^3 = 2(a/b) + 4\n\nLet me set k = a/b. Then:\n\nk³ = 2k + 4\n\nSo, k³ - 2k - 4 = 0\n\nWe need to solve this cubic equation for k. Let's try rational roots. The possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±4.\n\nTest k=1: 1 - 2 -4 = -5 ≠0\n\nk=2: 8 -4 -4=0. Yes, k=2 is a root.\n\nSo, factor (k - 2) from k³ - 2k -4.\n\nUsing polynomial division or synthetic division:\n\nDivide k³ - 2k -4 by (k - 2):\n\nCoefficients: 1 (k³), 0 (k²), -2 (k), -4 (constant)\n\nUsing synthetic division with root 2:\n\n2 | 1   0   -2   -4\n\n   |     2   4   4\n\n   -----------------\n\n   1   2   2   0\n\nSo, quotient is k² + 2k + 2. Therefore:\n\nk³ - 2k -4 = (k - 2)(k² + 2k + 2)\n\nThe quadratic factor k² + 2k + 2 has discriminant 4 - 8 = -4 < 0, so no real roots. Therefore, the only real solution is k=2.\n\nThus, a/b=2 => a=2b.\n\nSo, if a=2b, then the equation a³=2ab² +4b³ is satisfied. Therefore, when a=2b, the third fraction becomes equal to F.\n\nThus, in this case, if a=2b, then with c = a²/(a + 2b), substituting a=2b:\n\nc = (4b²)/(2b + 2b) = 4b²/(4b) = b.\n\nWait, so c = b. But the problem states that a, b, c are distinct non-zero real numbers. If c = b, then c and b are the same, which is not allowed. Therefore, this leads to a contradiction because c would equal b, violating the distinctness.\n\nHmm, so this suggests that assuming a=2b leads to c=b, which is not allowed. Therefore, this path does not give a valid solution.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check.\n\nWe found that if a=2b, then c= [a²]/(a + 2b) = (4b²)/(2b + 2b) = (4b²)/(4b) = b. So, c = b. But the problem requires a, b, c to be distinct. Therefore, this case is invalid. Therefore, even though algebraically we arrived at a=2b leading to c=b, which is not allowed, perhaps there is another way?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the assumption that a + b ≠0 is not valid. So, when we divided by (a + b), we assumed a + b ≠0. So, perhaps there are cases where a + b =0, which could be another possibility.\n\nLet me consider the case when a + b =0. If a + b =0, then a = -b. Let's see if this can work.\n\nIf a = -b, then let's substitute into the first fraction", "answer": "Zachodzi równość  \n\\((a + b)(b^2 + bc + c^2) - (b + c)(a^2 + ab + b^2) =\\)  \n\\[\n= b^2(a + b - b - c) + c(a + b)(b + c) - a(b + c)(a + b) =\n\\]  \n\\[\n= (c - a)((a + b)(b + c) - b^2) = (c - a)(ab + bc + ca).\n\\]  "}

Rozstrzygnąć, czy α musi być liczbą wymierną.", "response": "\nOkay, so I have this problem here: Let α be a real number such that tan(απ) = √2. We need to determine whether α must be a rational number. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the tangent function, tan(θ), has a period of π. That means tan(θ) = tan(θ + kπ) for any integer k. So, if tan(απ) = √2, then απ could be an angle whose tangent is √2, but also considering the periodicity, there might be multiple solutions for α. But the question is about whether α must be rational. So, rational here means a fraction of two integers, right?\n\nLet me start by recalling that the solutions to tan(θ) = √2 are all angles θ such that θ = arctan(√2) + kπ, where k is any integer. So, substituting θ with απ, we get απ = arctan(√2) + kπ. Then, solving for α, we have α = [arctan(√2) + kπ]/π = [arctan(√2)/π] + k. So, α is of the form k + [arctan(√2)/π], where k is an integer.\n\nNow, the question is whether α must be rational. If α is rational, then [arctan(√2)/π] must be rational as well, because k is already an integer. Wait, but [arctan(√2)/π] is a real number, but is it rational? If it were, then α would be integer plus a rational number, hence rational. So, the key question is: Is arctan(√2)/π a rational number?\n\nHmm, let's check that. Let me recall if arctan(√2) is a known angle. The arctangent of √2 is an angle whose tangent is √2. I know that tan(π/4) = 1, tan(π/3) = √3 ≈ 1.732, but √2 is approximately 1.414, which is between 1 and √3. So, arctan(√2) must be an angle in the first quadrant between π/4 and π/3. But is that angle a rational multiple of π? Probably not, because arctan(√2) is not a standard angle like π/6, π/4, π/3, etc. Those are all rational multiples of π, but √2 is irrational in some sense.\n\nWait, maybe I need to check if arctan(√2) is a rational multiple of π. Let's suppose that arctan(√2) = (p/q)π, where p and q are integers. Then, taking tangent on both sides, we get tan(arctan(√2)) = tan((p/q)π). The left side is √2, and the right side is tan((p/q)π). But tan(nπ) = 0 for integer n, and tan((2n+1)π/2) is undefined. For other rational multiples, maybe it's possible?\n\nBut I don't recall any standard angles that have arctangent equal to a rational multiple of π. So, perhaps arctan(√2) is not a rational multiple of π. If that's the case, then arctan(√2)/π would not be rational, hence α would be k + irrational, which would make α irrational. Therefore, α cannot be rational. So, does that mean the answer is no, α does not have to be rational?\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way α could still be rational even if arctan(√2)/π is irrational? For example, if [arctan(√2)/π] is irrational, but added to integer k gives a rational number. But how could that happen? If [arctan(√2)/π] is irrational, then adding it to integer k (which is rational) would result in an irrational number, right? Because the sum of a rational and irrational is irrational. Therefore, α would be irrational in any case. Therefore, α can't be rational.\n\nBut wait, let me verify this. Suppose arctan(√2) = (p/q)π + r, where r is irrational. But if that's the case, then α = k + (p/q)π + r. If (p/q)π is rational, then α would be k + rational + r, which is irrational. Because adding a rational and an irrational gives an irrational number. So yes, if arctan(√2) is not a rational multiple of π, then α would be irrational. Therefore, if we can prove that arctan(√2) is not a rational multiple of π, then α can't be rational.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to show that arctan(√2) is not a rational multiple of π. Let me think. Suppose for contradiction that arctan(√2) = (a/b)π, where a and b are integers with no common factors. Then, tan(arctan(√2)) = tan((a/b)π). The left side is √2, and the right side is tan((a/b)π). But tan((a/b)π) is tan(kπ + (a/b - k)π) = tan((a/b - k)π) for some integer k. However, tan(nπ) = 0 for integer n, so unless (a/b - k) is an integer, which would make tan((a/b - k)π) = 0. Therefore, unless a/b is an integer, tan((a/b)π) would not be zero, but instead, it would be some value. However, √2 is not zero, so this isn't possible. Therefore, the assumption that arctan(√2) is a rational multiple of π leads to a contradiction. Therefore, arctan(√2) is not a rational multiple of π, hence arctan(√2)/π is not rational, and α = k + arctan(√2)/π is not rational.\n\nTherefore, α cannot be rational. So, the answer should be no, α does not have to be rational.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another approach. Maybe using properties of transcendental numbers. If arctan(√2) is known to be transcendental, then arctan(√2)/π would be transcendental divided by π. But transcendental numbers divided by π are not necessarily transcendental. For example, log(2)/π is transcendental, but not necessarily. However, I might be mixing up some theorems here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem, which states that if α is algebraic (i.e., a root of a non-zero polynomial with integer coefficients), then e^α is transcendental. But I don't know if that's applicable here.\n\nWait, but here we have arctan(√2). Let's think differently. Suppose arctan(√2) = θ, so tanθ = √2. Then, if θ were a rational multiple of π, say θ = (p/q)π, then tan(p/q π) = √2. But tan(p/q π) is equal to the tangent of an angle that's a multiple of π/q. For certain q, this could be a multiple of π/2, but √2 isn't 0 or undefined. Wait, let's try specific values. For example, if q=2, then p/q π could be π/2 or π. But tan(π/2) is undefined, tan(π) is 0. So, no. If q=3, then possible angles are π/3, 2π/3, etc. tan(π/3) = √3 ≈1.732, tan(2π/3) = -√3, which are irrational. If q=4, tan(π/4)=1, tan(π/2) undefined, etc. So, none of these give √2. For q=1, tan(π) = 0. For q=5, tan(π/5) and tan(2π/5) are irrational. So, in general, tan(p/q π) for p and q integers is often irrational unless specific conditions are met. But in our case, tanθ = √2. So, can θ be a rational multiple of π?\n\nBut even if we can't find such a θ, the key point is that arctan(√2) isn't a rational multiple of π. Therefore, α = k + irrational, which is irrational. Hence, α cannot be rational.\n\nAnother angle: suppose that α is rational. Then, α = a/b, where a and b are integers with no common factors. Then, tan(απ) = tan(aπ/b). But the tangent function has period π, so tan(aπ/b) = tan(aπ/b mod π). However, if a/b is not an integer, then aπ/b is not an integer multiple of π, so tan(aπ/b) is some real number. But we know that tan(aπ/b) must equal √2. So, if α is rational, then tan(απ) = √2. But is there a rational number α such that tan(απ) is √2?\n\nBut we already saw that the solutions to tanθ = √2 are θ = arctan(√2) + kπ, so απ = arctan(√2) + kπ. Therefore, α = [arctan(√2)/π] + k. So, if α is rational, then [arctan(√2)/π] must be rational. But we just concluded that arctan(√2)/π is irrational. Therefore, α cannot be rational.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the fact that sqrt(2) is not a rational multiple of pi. But that's a bit circular.\n\nWait, perhaps using the Gelfond-Schneider theorem. But I don't know if that applies here. The theorem states that if a and b are algebraic numbers with a ≠ 0, 1 and b irrational, then a^b is transcendental. But I'm not sure how that relates here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think about the equation tan(απ) = √2. If α is rational, then α = p/q, so tan(pπ/q) = √2. But for some rational numbers p/q, tan(pπ/q) is rational or irrational. For example, tan(π/4) = 1, which is rational. Similarly, tan(π/3) = √3, which is irrational. So, in some cases, tan(pπ/q) is rational, like π/4, but not always. But in our case, √2 is irrational. So, is there a rational p/q such that tan(pπ/q) = √2? For example, if p/q = 1/2, then tan(π/2) is undefined. If p/q = 1/4, tan(π/4) = 1. If p/q = 1/3, tan(π/3) = √3. If p/q = 2/3, tan(2π/3) = -√3. If p/q = 3/4, tan(3π/4) = -1. If p/q = 1/6, tan(π/6) = 1/√3. So, none of these give √2. So, maybe there's no rational p/q such that tan(pπ/q) = √2. Therefore, if tan(απ) = √2, then α must be irrational.\n\nBut this is a bit hand-wavy. How can we be sure there's no such rational number?\n\nAlternatively, suppose α is rational. Then, α = a/b with a and b integers. Then, tan(aπ/b) = √2. But tan(aπ/b) is a real number, but is it possible that this real number is √2?\n\nBut even if tan(aπ/b) = √2, then aπ/b must be an angle whose tangent is √2. But we know that tan^{-1}(√2) is not a rational multiple of π, as we discussed earlier. Therefore, if a/b is rational, then aπ/b is a rational multiple of π, which would mean that tan(aπ/b) is tan(rational multiple of π), which is irrational unless it's 0 or undefined. But √2 is neither 0 nor undefined, so this is a contradiction. Therefore, if α is rational, then tan(απ) = √2 is impossible. Therefore, α cannot be rational.\n\nTherefore, the answer is no, α does not have to be rational.\n\nBut let me check if there's a formal theorem or result that supports this. I recall that transcendental numbers are numbers that are not algebraic, and certain functions like logarithms, exponentials, etc., are transcendental. But in this case, we're dealing with the tangent function.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem, which states that if α is algebraic, then e^α is transcendental. However, I don't see the direct connection here.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that α is rational. Then, α = p/q, with p and q integers. Then, q tan(απ) = q√2. But q tan(απ) must be an algebraic number because tan(απ) is either 0 or irrational (since απ is not a multiple of π/2, which would make tan(απ) undefined). Wait, if απ is a multiple of π/2, then tan(απ) is undefined or infinity, which isn't the case here. So, tan(απ) is actually a real number, but not necessarily rational. However, according to our previous reasoning, if α is rational, then tan(απ) must be irrational, which it is in our case (since √2 is irrational). But does that imply anything about α being rational?\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the Gelfond-Schneider theorem. If we can show that α is such that tan(απ) = √2, then α must be irrational. But how?\n\nAlternatively, suppose that α is rational, then α = p/q. Then, tan(pπ/q) = √2. Let's consider the equation tan(pπ/q) = √2. For this to hold, pπ/q must be an angle whose tangent is √2. However, as we saw earlier, unless p/q is a multiple of a specific angle, this is not possible. But even if p/q is a rational multiple of π, unless it's a specific angle, the tangent is not √2. Since √2 isn't the tangent of any rational multiple of π, as per our earlier reasoning, α cannot be rational.\n\nTherefore, after all these considerations, the conclusion is that", "answer": "Udowodnijmy, że liczba α jest niewymierna.\nZałóżmy, że tak nie jest i niech  \n\\[\n\\alpha = \\frac{p}{q},\n\\]\ngdzie \\( p \\) i \\( q > 0 \\) oznaczają liczby całkowite.

The question is about finding all real numbers C such that for every integer n ≥ 2, an n x n chessboard has a \"lovely\" subset with at most Cn² squares. A lovely subset is defined as a set of squares where every cycle on the subset contains at least one square from the subset. So, the goal is to find the minimal C where this is possible, or maybe all such Cs.\n\nFirst, let's make sure I understand the problem correctly. A cycle here is a closed path on the chessboard where consecutive squares share a common side, and the path loops back to the starting square. So, for example, a 4-cycle would be a square loop, like the four squares forming a square. But cycles can be longer, like a 5-cycle, 6-cycle, etc. The key is that in any such cycle, at least one square must be in the lovely subset. Therefore, the lovely subset must intersect every cycle on the chessboard.\n\nSo, the problem is equivalent to covering all cycles on the chessboard with as few squares as possible, and we need to find the minimal C such that this covering has at most Cn² squares for any n ≥ 2. Then, the answer would be the minimal such C.\n\nThis seems related to the concept of covering all cycles in a graph with a vertex cover. In graph theory, a vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge is incident to at least one vertex in the set. But here, the condition is stronger: it's not about edges but about cycles. So, it's a different kind of covering. However, perhaps similar techniques can be applied.\n\nLet me think. In a graph, a vertex cover can be found using various algorithms, but maybe here we need something more specific. For bipartite graphs, Konig's theorem tells us that the size of the minimum vertex cover equals the size of the maximum matching. But our graph is the chessboard adjacency graph, which is a grid graph. Grid graphs are bipartite, right? Because you can color the squares like a chessboard: black and white alternately. Any two adjacent squares are of different colors. So, the grid graph is bipartite.\n\nBut how does this relate to vertex covers? If we can find a vertex cover in the grid graph, then that would give us a set of squares such that every edge (i.e., every consecutive pair in the chessboard) is incident to at least one vertex in the cover. However, the problem requires that every cycle is incident to at least one vertex in the lovely subset. So, it's a bit different. Because a cycle is a closed path, not just an edge.\n\nWait, but in a bipartite graph, any cycle must have even length, and in a bipartite graph, the cycles alternate between the two colors. So, if we pick all the squares of one color, say all black squares, then every cycle must have at least two squares, one from each color. But since we're only picking one color, we'll have a cycle that alternates between the two colors, but if we only pick one color, then all cycles would have all their squares of one color, which would not include any of the picked squares. Wait, no. Wait, if we pick all black squares, then a cycle that goes through black squares would have all their squares in the cycle, but since we only pick black squares, the cycle would be entirely contained within the lovely subset. But the condition is that every cycle on the lovely subset must contain at least one square from the lovely subset. So, if we pick all black squares, then a 4-cycle (like the square loop) would include two black squares and two white squares. But if we only pick black squares, then the 4-cycle would have two black squares, and since our lovely subset is black squares, those two would be in the subset. So, actually, the minimal vertex cover is half the number of squares in a bipartition. But wait, in a grid graph, the vertex cover problem is difficult, but for bipartite graphs, König's theorem applies, so the minimum vertex cover is equal to the maximum matching.\n\nBut we need the minimum such C that the size of the vertex cover is at most Cn². However, in a grid graph, the maximum matching is known. For an n x n grid, the maximum matching is n(n-1)/2, which is the number of edges in a perfect matching if n is even. Wait, but the maximum matching in a grid graph is actually different. Let me recall. For an n x n grid, the maximum matching is roughly n²/2, but I need to check.\n\nWait, no. For a bipartite graph, the maximum matching can be as large as the number of vertices, but in a grid graph, which is a bipartite graph with partitions of size n² (if n is even) or nearly equal, the maximum matching can be up to n²/2. For example, in a grid graph, a perfect matching exists if the grid is even-sized. So, if n is even, the maximum matching is n²/2, and if n is odd, it's (n² - 1)/2. Therefore, by König's theorem, the minimum vertex cover would be equal to the maximum matching. So, for even n, the minimum vertex cover is n²/2, and for odd n, it's (n² - 1)/2. Therefore, the vertex cover size is roughly n²/2. But wait, wait, König's theorem states that in bipartite graphs, the size of the maximum matching equals the size of the minimum vertex cover. So, if the maximum matching is n²/2, then the minimum vertex cover is also n²/2. However, in reality, the grid graph is not a complete bipartite graph; it's a grid, so the structure is different. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing with different graphs.\n\nWait, the grid graph is a bipartite graph with two color classes. For an n x n grid, each square is either black or white. The total number of squares is n². Each edge connects a black and a white square. So, the maximum matching in a bipartite graph with partitions of size m and n is min(m, n). So, in this case, both partitions have size ⌈n²/2⌉ and ⌊n²/2⌋. Therefore, the maximum matching is ⌊n²/2⌋. Therefore, by König's theorem, the minimum vertex cover is also ⌊n²/2⌋. Therefore, the minimum vertex cover size is roughly n²/2. So, if we take all squares of one color, say black squares, then every cycle must have at least two squares of one color. Wait, but in a cycle, which alternates colors, a cycle of even length would have exactly n/2 of each color if the cycle length is n. Wait, no. Wait, if you have a cycle of length m, which is even, then in a bipartite graph, the cycle alternates colors, so for a cycle of length m, there are m/2 of each color. Therefore, if you take all squares of one color, then every cycle of even length will include squares from both colors, but the vertices in the cycle are all squares of one color. Wait, no. For example, a 4-cycle (square loop) has two black and two white squares. If we take all black squares, then the 4-cycle will have two black squares, which are all in the lovely subset. Similarly, a 6-cycle (hexagon) would have three black and three white squares. If we take all black squares, then the 6-cycle includes three black squares, so again all in the subset. Therefore, if we take all squares of one color, then every cycle (whether even or odd length) will include squares from the lovely subset. Wait, but cycles of odd length can't exist in a bipartite graph, because in a bipartite graph, all cycles are of even length. So, actually, in the chessboard grid graph, all cycles are of even length. Therefore, if we take all squares of one color, then every cycle (which is a closed walk where consecutive squares share a side) must have even length. But in that case, all cycles are of even length, but in the chessboard grid, cycles can be of any even length. Wait, but any cycle on the chessboard is a closed path where consecutive squares are adjacent. For example, a 4-cycle, 6-cycle, etc. But in the chessboard grid, any cycle can be of any even length, as long as it's a closed loop.\n\nWait, but if we take all squares of one color, say black squares, then any cycle must alternate between black and white squares. Therefore, a cycle of length m (even) will have m/2 black squares and m/2 white squares. So, if we take all black squares, then the cycle will include all its black squares, which are in the lovely subset. Therefore, the lovely subset (all black squares) would satisfy the condition that every cycle contains at least one square from the subset. Because every cycle has even length, and in a cycle of even length, half of the squares are black and half are white. Therefore, the cycle would have all black squares (if we take all black squares) or all white squares (if we take all white squares). Wait, no. If we take all black squares, then a cycle of even length has m/2 black squares and m/2 white squares. Therefore, the cycle will contain m/2 black squares and m/2 white squares. Since the subset is all black squares, then the cycle includes all black squares (which are in the subset), so the cycle is entirely contained within the subset. Therefore, the condition is satisfied.\n\nTherefore, in a bipartite graph like the chessboard grid, the vertex cover can be taken as all squares of one color, which is n²/2. Therefore, the minimal C is 1/2, since the size of the lovely subset is at most n²/2, which is Cn² with C=1/2.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"a lovely subset consisting of co points\". Wait, the problem statement says \"a lovely subset consisting of co points\". Wait, maybe \"co points\" is a typo and should be \"points\". Because \"co\" is a preposition meaning \"together\". So, likely a typo, and it should be \"lovely subset consisting of points\". Otherwise, \"co points\" would be confusing. So, assuming that's a typo, the problem is as stated: a lovely subset is a set of points (squares) such that every cycle on the set contains at least one point from the set.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the minimal C is 1/2, because you can take all squares of one color, which gives a lovely subset of size n²/2, which is Cn² with C=1/2. Moreover, this is the minimal possible, because you can't have a smaller vertex cover in a bipartite graph. Since König's theorem tells us that the minimum vertex cover size is equal to the maximum matching, which is n²/2 for the chessboard grid, so you can't do better than that. Therefore, the answer should be C=1/2.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me verify this with a small example. Let's take n=2. Then the chessboard is 2x2. The two-coloring would have two black squares and two white squares. If we take all black squares (size 2), then any cycle must include both squares, which are in the subset. Similarly, if we take all white squares. For n=2, the maximum cycle is the 4-cycle, which is the entire chessboard. So, taking all black squares would cover that cycle. Similarly, for n=3, the 3x3 grid. The two-coloring would have 5 squares of one color and 4 of the other. Taking all 5 squares would cover all cycles (which are all even-length cycles, so 4, 6, 8, etc.), since any 4-cycle has 2 of each color, so all 2 black squares (from the subset) are included. Similarly, a 6-cycle would have 3 black and 3 white squares, so all 3 black squares are included. Therefore, taking all squares of one color works.\n\nBut is there a way to cover all cycles with fewer squares? Suppose n=3. If we try to take less than 5 squares, say 4 squares. Then, is there a cycle that doesn't include any of the 4 squares? For example, place the 4 squares in such a way that there are two adjacent squares, and the other two are not part of any cycle. Wait, but in the 3x3 grid, any cycle of length 4 must include four squares. For example, the four corners form a square. If we take 4 squares, maybe they include all four corners. Then, the other five squares (including the center) would form another cycle. Wait, but in reality, the 3x3 grid has multiple cycles. For example, the four corners form a square, and also, there are other 4-cycles like the ones formed by the edges. Wait, actually, in a 3x3 grid, the 4-cycles are the four corners, the four edges, and the center with four edges. Wait, no. Wait, in a 3x3 grid, the 4-cycles are the squares themselves. For example, each 2x2 block in the 3x3 grid forms a 4-cycle. There are four such blocks: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right. Each is a 4-cycle. So, if we place a square in each of these four blocks, that's four squares. Then, the remaining five squares (the center and the other four corners) form another 4-cycle. Wait, if we take all four corner squares, then the remaining five squares include the center and the midpoints. Wait, but the midpoints are adjacent to corners. For example, the top-left corner is (1,1), adjacent to (1,2) and (2,1). The center is (2,2), adjacent to all four midpoints. So, maybe the remaining five squares (center and four midpoints) form another 4-cycle. For example, the four midpoints (2,1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,2) form a cycle of length 4. Then, the center (2,2) is adjacent to all of them. So, if we take four corner squares, then the center and the four midpoints form another 4-cycle. Therefore, even if we take four squares, there are still cycles that don't include any of them. Therefore, we need at least five squares. Hence, for n=3, the minimal C is 5/9 ≈ 0.555..., which is larger than 1/2. Therefore, the initial thought that C=1/2 is correct, since in the case of n=2, you can get away with 2 squares, which is 1/2 of 4, and for n=3, you need at least ", "answer": "Udowodnimy, że wszystkie liczby \\(C \\geq \\frac{1}{3}\\) spełniają warunki zadania.

The equations relate their evaluations at x² + 1 to each other and to linear terms of x. The challenge is to find all such polynomials.\n\nFirst, since these are polynomial equations, the degrees of the polynomials must be considered. Let me think about the degrees of P and Q.\n\nLet’s denote the degrees of P and Q as deg(P) = m and deg(Q) = n, respectively.\n\nFor the first equation: P(x² + 1) = Q(x)² + 2x.\n\nThe left-hand side (LHS) is P evaluated at x² + 1. If P is a polynomial of degree m, then substituting x² + 1 into P will result in a polynomial of degree 2m, because the highest degree term in x² + 1 is x², and raising that to the m-th power would give x^(2m).\n\nThe right-hand side (RHS) is Q(x)² + 2x. Q(x) is a polynomial of degree n, so Q(x)² is a polynomial of degree 2n. The term 2x is of degree 1. Therefore, the RHS is a polynomial of degree max(2n, 1). Since 2n is likely larger than 1 (unless n=0), the RHS is degree 2n.\n\nTherefore, equating the degrees from both sides:\n\n2m = 2n => m = n.\n\nSo the degrees of P and Q are equal. That's a useful piece of information.\n\nNow, looking at the second equation: Q(x² + 1) = P(x)².\n\nSimilarly, the LHS here is Q evaluated at x² + 1. If Q has degree n, then substituting x² + 1 into Q would result in a polynomial of degree 2n.\n\nThe RHS is P(x)², which is a polynomial of degree 2m (since P has degree m). But we already found that m = n, so the RHS is degree 2n. Therefore, equating degrees:\n\n2n = 2n, which is consistent. So that doesn't give new information.\n\nBut since m = n, we can use that to relate the degrees.\n\nSo far, we know that P and Q have the same degree, say k. Let’s denote k = deg(P) = deg(Q).\n\nNow, let’s consider the leading coefficients. Let’s suppose P(x) = a_k x^k + lower terms, and Q(x) = b_k x^k + lower terms.\n\nFor the first equation: P(x² + 1) = Q(x)² + 2x.\n\nThe leading term of P(x² + 1) is a_k (x²)^k = a_k x^{2k}.\n\nThe leading term of Q(x)² is (b_k x^k)^2 = b_k² x^{2k}.\n\nThe RHS Q(x)² + 2x has leading term b_k² x^{2k} and a lower term. Therefore, equating leading coefficients:\n\na_k = b_k².\n\nSo the leading coefficients must satisfy a_k = b_k².\n\nSimilarly, for the second equation: Q(x² + 1) = P(x)².\n\nThe leading term of Q(x² + 1) is b_k ( (x²)^k ) = b_k x^{2k}.\n\nThe leading term of P(x)² is (a_k x^k)^2 = a_k² x^{2k}.\n\nTherefore, equating leading coefficients:\n\nb_k = a_k².\n\nBut from the first equation, we already have a_k = b_k². So substituting b_k = a_k² into this equation:\n\na_k = (a_k²)^2 => a_k = a_k⁴.\n\nSo this gives us a_k = 0 or a_k = 1 or a_k = -1.\n\nBut let's check if a_k can be negative. If a_k is negative, then b_k = a_k² would be positive. However, the leading term of P(x² + 1) is a_k x^{2k}, which would be negative, but Q(x)² is non-negative (since squares of real numbers are non-negative), and adding 2x (which can be negative) might not affect the leading term. Wait, but if a_k is negative, then the leading term of the LHS is negative, whereas the RHS Q(x)² + 2x has leading term b_k² x^{2k}, which is non-negative because it's a square. Therefore, the leading term of the RHS is non-negative, and the LHS is negative. That would imply that a negative leading coefficient is impossible. Therefore, a_k must be non-negative.\n\nSo possible values for a_k are 0, 1, or -1. But since we just concluded that a_k must be non-negative, a_k can only be 0 or 1.\n\nCase 1: a_k = 0.\n\nIf a_k = 0, then from the first equation, a_k = b_k² => 0 = b_k² => b_k = 0.\n\nBut then, looking at the second equation, Q(x² + 1) = P(x)². If Q has leading coefficient 0, then Q(x) is a polynomial of degree less than k, but since we already have m = n, it's possible that Q has degree less than k, but let's see.\n\nWait, if a_k = 0, then P has degree less than k. Similarly, if b_k = 0, then Q has degree less than k. But in the first equation, we have P(x² + 1) = Q(x)² + 2x. If P has degree less than k, then P(x² + 1) has degree 2*(k-1). But Q(x)² has degree 2k, so 2*(k - 1) must equal 2k, which implies that 2k - 2 = 2k => -2 = 0, which is impossible. Therefore, this case leads to a contradiction. Therefore, a_k cannot be 0. So a_k must be 1.\n\nCase 2: a_k = 1.\n\nThen b_k = a_k² = 1² = 1.\n\nNow, moving on to the leading coefficients, we have a_k = 1 and b_k = 1.\n\nNow, let's consider the next coefficients. Let's denote P(x) = x^k + lower degree terms and Q(x) = x^k + lower degree terms.\n\nBut perhaps we can look at the coefficients of x^{2k - 1} in the first equation.\n\nWait, let's think about the expansion of P(x² + 1). Since P is a polynomial of degree k, when we substitute x² + 1 into it, the leading term is (x²)^k = x^{2k}. The next term would be k*(x²)^{k-1}*(1) = k x^{2k - 2}, but wait, actually, the expansion of (x² + 1)^k is a sum from i=0 to k of C(k, i) x^{2i} * 1^{k - i}. So when we substitute into P, we have P(x² + 1) = a_k (x² + 1)^k + lower degree terms.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of x^{2k - 1} in P(x² + 1) is zero, since all the exponents in (x² + 1)^k are even. Therefore, the coefficient of x^{2k - 1} in P(x² + 1) is zero.\n\nOn the other hand, the RHS is Q(x)² + 2x. Q(x) is a polynomial of degree k, so Q(x)² has degree 2k. The coefficient of x^{2k - 1} in Q(x)² would come from the cross terms when squaring Q(x). Let’s suppose Q(x) = x^k + c_{k-1}x^{k-1} + ... + c_0. Then Q(x)² would have terms like (x^k)^2 = x^{2k}, and the term 2*(x^k)*(c_{k-1}x^{k-1}) = 2c_{k-1}x^{2k - 1}, and the other terms would be x^{2k - 2}, etc. So the coefficient of x^{2k - 1} in Q(x)² is 2c_{k-1}.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of x^{2k - 1} on the RHS is 2c_{k-1}. Since the LHS has coefficient 0, we have 2c_{k-1} = 0 => c_{k-1} = 0.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of x^{k - 1} in Q(x) is zero.\n\nSimilarly, looking at the x^{2k} term: on the LHS, P(x² + 1) has leading term x^{2k}, and the RHS has Q(x)², which also has leading term x^{2k}. Therefore, the leading coefficients are equal, which is already satisfied (a_k = b_k = 1).\n\nNow, moving to the next term, perhaps. Let's look at the coefficient of x^{2k - 2} in both sides.\n\nFor the LHS: P(x² + 1). The term after x^{2k} would be k*(x²)^{k-1}*(1) = k x^{2k - 2}, but wait, in P(x² + 1), each coefficient of x^{2i} in P is multiplied by (x² + 1)^{k - i}. Wait, maybe this approach is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since P is a polynomial of degree k, we can write P(x) = x^k + a_{k-1}x^{k - 1} + ... + a_0.\n\nThen P(x² + 1) = (x² + 1)^k + a_{k-1}(x² + 1)^{k - 1} + ... + a_0.\n\nSimilarly, Q(x) is a polynomial of degree k, so Q(x² + 1) = (x² + 1)^k + b_{k-1}(x² + 1)^{k - 1} + ... + b_0.\n\nBut maybe this approach is too messy. Let me think of specific cases.\n\nSuppose k = 1. Then P and Q are linear polynomials.\n\nLet’s assume k = 1. Then P(x) = ax + b, Q(x) = cx + d.\n\nThen the first equation: P(x² + 1) = a(x² + 1) + b = ax² + a + b.\n\nThis must equal Q(x)² + 2x = (cx + d)^2 + 2x = c²x² + 2cdx + d² + 2x.\n\nEquate coefficients:\n\nFor x²: a = c²\n\nFor x: 0 = 2cd + 2 => 2cd = -2 => cd = -1\n\nFor constant term: a + b = d².\n\nSo we have:\n\n1. a = c²\n\n2. cd = -1\n\n3. a + b = d².\n\nLet’s solve these equations.\n\nFrom 1: a = c². From 2: d = -1/c. Then from 3: a + b = d² => c² + b = (1/c²). So b = (1/c²) - c².\n\nBut b must be a real number. Since P is a linear polynomial, coefficients are real. So c ≠ 0.\n\nTherefore, the possible solutions for k = 1 are:\n\nb = 1/c² - c².\n\nSo for any non-zero real c, we can define a linear polynomial Q(x) = cx + d with d = -1/c and a = c², and P(x) = c²x + (1/c² - c²).\n\nBut we also have the second equation: Q(x² + 1) = P(x)².\n\nLet’s check this for the linear case.\n\nQ(x² + 1) = c(x² + 1) + d = c x² + c + d.\n\nP(x)² = (c² x + (1/c² - c²))² = c^4 x² + 2 c² (1/c² - c²) x + (1/c² - c²)^2.\n\nSimplify:\n\n= c^4 x² + 2(1 - c^4) x + (1/c² - c²)^2.\n\nSet this equal to Q(x² + 1) = c x² + c + d.\n\nBut we know d = -1/c, so Q(x² + 1) = c x² + c - 1/c.\n\nTherefore, equate:\n\nc^4 x² + 2(1 - c^4) x + (1/c² - c²)^2 = c x² + c - 1/c.\n\nSo comparing coefficients:\n\nCoefficient of x²: c^4 = c => c^4 - c = 0 => c(c^3 - 1) = 0 => c = 0 or c^3 = 1. But c ≠ 0 (since d = -1/c must be defined). So c^3 = 1 => c = 1.\n\nTherefore, c = 1. Then d = -1/c = -1. Then a = c² = 1. P(x) = x + b, where b = (1/c²) - c² = 1 - 1 = 0. So P(x) = x. Then check Q(x) = x - 1.\n\nCheck second equation: Q(x² + 1) = x² - 1. P(x)² = x². So x² - 1 = x²? No, that's not true. Wait, that's a contradiction. Wait, this suggests that even though we found c = 1, the second equation doesn't hold. So something is wrong here.\n\nWait, let's retrace. When c = 1, we have:\n\nQ(x) = x - 1.\n\nThen Q(x² + 1) = x² + 1 - 1 = x².\n\nP(x)² = x². So x² = x². That works! Wait, but earlier when I substituted, I thought it didn't. Wait, no, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, P(x) = x, Q(x) = x - 1.\n\nCheck first equation: P(x² + 1) = x² + 1.

", "response": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this game between two players on an n-gon. The rules are a bit tricky, so I need to break them down step by step. The game is played by placing pawns on the vertices of an n-gon, and players take turns moving their pawns. The move is to a non-adjacent vertex that's not occupied by the opponent's pawn. The player who can't move loses. We need to determine, depending on n, if the first player has a winning strategy or the second player does.\n\nFirst, let's visualize the game. An n-gon has n vertices, all connected in a cycle. Each player places a pawn on an empty vertex in their turn. The move is to a non-adjacent vertex that's empty. So, the available moves depend on the current state of the board. The key here is that each player can only move their pawn to a vertex that's not adjacent to the opponent's pawn and is not occupied by the opponent's pawn. Wait, does the move have to be non-adjacent to the opponent's pawn or just non-adjacent to the opponent's pawn? The problem says \"non-adjacent to the vertex occupied by the opponent's pawn.\" So, the move can't be to any adjacent vertex, but it can be any other vertex, even adjacent to the player's own pawn. So, the player can move their pawn to a vertex that's not adjacent to the opponent's pawn, regardless of their own.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So, the opponent's pawn can block the player's moves, but the player can still move to adjacent vertices. So, the game is somewhat like a race to occupy all vertices, but the opponent's pawn can block the player's moves. The player who cannot move loses.\n\nLet me think about small n to see if there's a pattern.\n\nCase n=4 (a square). The first player places a pawn on a vertex. The second player can then place a pawn on any non-adjacent vertex. Wait, in a square, adjacent vertices are those sharing an edge. So, in a square, each vertex is adjacent to two others. So, if the first player places a pawn on vertex A, the second player can place on B or C (non-adjacent to A). Let's say the second player places on B. Then, the first player's turn. The available vertices are C and D. But the first player needs to move to a non-adjacent vertex to B. B is adjacent to A and C. So, non-adjacent to B would be D. So, the first player can move to D. Then the second player's turn. The available vertices are C. Is C adjacent to D? In the square, C is adjacent to B and D. So, C is adjacent to D, so the second player can't move. Wait, but the second player's pawn is on B. The available vertices are C and D. The second player needs to move to a non-adjacent vertex to B (which is D). So, the second player can move to D. Then the first player's turn. The available vertices are C. The first player's pawn is on D, so the available vertices are C and A. But A is occupied by the first player's pawn. So, the first player can move to C. Then the second player's turn. The available vertices are A and B. The second player's pawn is on D, so non-adjacent to D are A and C. A is occupied, so the second player can move to C. Then the first player's turn. The available vertices are A. The first player's pawn is on C, so non-adjacent to C are A and D. A is occupied, so the first player can't move. Wait, but the first player's pawn is on C. The available vertices are A and D. But A is occupied, so the first player can move to D. Wait, but D is already occupied by the second player's pawn. So, the first player can't move. So, the first player loses. Hmm, so in the square case, the second player wins.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Let's try a different sequence. First player places on A. Second player places on C. Then first player's turn. Available vertices are B and D. To move to a non-adjacent to C (which are B and D). The first player's pawn is on A. So, non-adjacent to C is B and D. So, first player can move to B or D. Suppose he moves to B. Then the second player's turn. Available vertices: D and A. The second player needs to move to a non-adjacent to B (which is D). So, second player moves to D. First player's turn. Available vertices: A. The first player needs to move to a non-adjacent to D. The only non-adjacent is A. So, first player moves to A. Second player's turn. Available vertices: C. The second player needs to move to a non-adjacent to D (which is A). A is occupied, so second player can't move. Wait, but the second player's pawn is on D. So, available vertices are A and C. Non-adjacent to D are A and C. A is occupied, so second player moves to C. First player's turn. Available vertices: A and B. The first player's pawn is on A. Non-adjacent to A are B and C. B is occupied, so first player moves to B. Second player's turn. Available vertices: A and C. The second player's pawn is on C. Non-adjacent to C are A and B. A is occupied, so second player moves to A. First player's turn. Available vertices: B. The first player's pawn is on B. Non-adjacent to B are A and C. A is occupied, so first player can't move. So, first player loses again. Hmm, seems like the second player can always win on the square. Wait, maybe the pattern is that for even n, the second player can win? Let's check n=5.\n\nCase n=5 (a pentagon). First player places on A. Second player places on C (non-adjacent to A). First player's turn. Available vertices: B, D, E. To move to a non-adjacent to C. The non-adjacent to C are B, D, and E? Wait, in a pentagon, each vertex is adjacent to two others. So, C is adjacent to B and D. So, non-adjacent to C are A, E. But A is occupied, so first player can move to E. Then second player's turn. Available vertices: B, D. The second player's pawn is on C. Non-adjacent to C are A and E. A is occupied, E is occupied. So, no available moves. Wait, but the second player's pawn is on C, and the available vertices are B and D. Are B and D adjacent to C? In a pentagon, C is adjacent to B and D. So, B is adjacent to C, D is adjacent to C. So, non-adjacent to C are A and E, but those are already occupied. So, the second player can't move. So, second player loses. Wait, but first player moved to E, then second player has no moves. So, first player wins? But that contradicts the previous square case. Wait, maybe my reasoning is off.\n\nWait, when the first player moves to E, the second player's pawn is on C. The available vertices are B and D. But the second player's pawn is on C, which is adjacent to B and D. So, the second player cannot move to B or D because they are adjacent to C. Therefore, the second player cannot move and loses. So, first player wins. Hmm. So, for n=5, first player can win. But n=4, second player can win. So, maybe the parity of n matters? But n=3 is excluded. Let's check n=6.\n\nCase n=6 (hexagon). First player places on A. Second player places on C. First player's turn. Available vertices: B, D, E, F. Needs to move to a non-adjacent to C. Non-adjacent to C are B, D, E, F? Wait, in a hexagon, each vertex is adjacent to two others. So, C is adjacent to B and D. Non-adjacent to C are E, F, and A. But A is occupied, so first player can move to E or F. Let's say he moves to E. Second player's turn. Available vertices: B, D, F. Second player's pawn is on C. Non-adjacent to C are B, D, E. But B and D are occupied, so available is F. Second player moves to F. First player's turn. Available vertices: B, D. First player's pawn is on E. Non-adjacent to E are B, F, and D. B and D are occupied, so first player can move to B or D. Let's say he moves to B. Second player's turn. Available vertices: D. The second player's pawn is on F. Non-adjacent to F are E, B. E is occupied, B is occupied. Second player can't move. Wait, but the second player's pawn is on F, and the available vertices are D. But D is adjacent to F? In a hexagon, each vertex is adjacent to two others. So, F is adjacent to E and G (assuming labeling). Wait, maybe I need to clarify the adjacency.\n\nWait, in a hexagon labeled A, B, C, D, E, F in order. So, each vertex is adjacent to the previous and next one. So, A is adjacent to B and F. B is adjacent to A and C. C is adjacent to B and D. D is adjacent to C and E. E is adjacent to D and F. F is adjacent to E and A. So, if first player moves to E, then the second player's pawn is on F. The available vertices are B and D. The second player's pawn is on F, so non-adjacent to F are B, C, D. But B and D are available, and C is occupied. So, second player can move to B or D. Suppose he moves to B. First player's turn. Available vertices: D. First player's pawn is on B. Non-adjacent to B are E, F, and A. E is occupied, F is occupied, A is occupied. So, first player can't move. Wait, but the first player's pawn is on B, and the available vertices are D. D is adjacent to C and E. So, D is not adjacent to B. Wait, in the hexagon, B is adjacent to A and C. So, D is not adjacent to B. Therefore, the first player can move to D. Then second player's turn. Available vertices: A. The second player's pawn is on B. Non-adjacent to B are E, F, and A. E and F are occupied, A is available. So, second player can move to A. First player's turn. Available vertices: C. First player's pawn is on D. Non-adjacent to D are B, E, F. B is occupied, E and F are occupied. So, first player can't move. Wait, but first player's pawn is on D, and the available vertices are C. C is adjacent to B and D. So, non-adjacent to D are B, E, F. B is occupied, E and F are occupied. So, first player can't move. Wait, but the first player's pawn is on D. So, the available vertices are A, C. Wait, no, all vertices are already occupied except maybe if there are others. Wait, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, after first player moves to D, second player moves to A. Then first player's turn. The available vertices are C. First player's pawn is on D. Non-adjacent to D are B, E, F. B and E, F are occupied. So, first player can't move. Wait, but the first player's pawn is on D, and the available vertices are C. But C is not adjacent to D. In the hexagon, C is adjacent to B and D. So, C is adjacent to D. Therefore, non-adjacent to D are B, E, F. None of those are available. So, first player loses. Wait, but the second player moved to A, which is adjacent to B and F. So, the second player could have moved to F instead. Let's backtrack.\n\nAfter first player moves to E, second player moves to F. Then first player's turn. Available vertices: B, D. First player's pawn is on B. Non-adjacent to B are E, F, and A. E and F are occupied, so available is A. But A is occupied. Wait, no, A is occupied, so first player cannot move. Wait, this is confusing. Maybe I need to map out all possible moves step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. For even n, the second player can win, and for odd n greater than 3, the first player can win? Let's check n=5 again. Wait, in n=5, first player could win. But n=5 is odd. So, maybe it's different. Alternatively, perhaps for n ≥ 4, the first player can win by mirroring the second player's moves? But in the n=5 case, the second player didn't mirror. Wait, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, think of the game as a graph where each vertex is a node, and edges connect adjacent vertices. The game is about moving to non-adjacent vertices. The losing condition is when you can't move. This resembles the game of Nim or other impartial games, but the moves depend on the opponent's pawn.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a variant of the game of Kayles or similar. Alternatively, think of it as a directed graph where each node is a state (current positions of both pawns) and edges represent moves. The player who cannot move loses. Then, the question is whether the starting position is a winning or losing position.\n\nBut given the complexity, maybe we can find a parity argument or pairing strategy.\n\nAnother approach: consider that once a pawn is placed on a vertex, it blocks all adjacent vertices. The opponent can then place their pawn on a non-adjacent vertex. The key is that the opponent can always mirror the first player's moves in some way, but depending on the parity of n.\n\nWait, in even n, maybe the second player can mirror the first player's moves. For example, if the first player places a pawn on vertex A, the second player places on vertex B (assuming B is two steps away). But in a hexagon, if the first player places on A, the second player places on C (opposite). Then, the first player places on D, second player places on E, and so on. But this might not always work because the available moves depend on the opponent's pawn.\n\nAlternatively, think of the game as a disjunct", "answer": "Załóżmy, że pierwszym graczem jest Ewa, a drugim — Jan.

The first equation relates x₁ and x₂, the second x₂ and x₃, and so on, with the last equation connecting xₙ back to x₁. Since all the equations are cyclic, maybe there's a pattern or symmetry here. \n\nLet me start by looking at the first equation:\n\n2x₁³ + 4 = x₁²(x₂ + 3)\n\nLet me rearrange this to solve for x₂ in terms of x₁. Let's subtract 2x₁³ and 4 from both sides:\n\n0 = x₁²x₂ + 3x₁² - 2x₁³ - 4\n\nThen, solving for x₂:\n\nx₁²x₂ = 2x₁³ - 3x₁² + 4\n\nDivide both sides by x₁² (assuming x₁ ≠ 0):\n\nx₂ = (2x₁³ - 3x₁² + 4)/x₁²\n\nSimplify that:\n\nx₂ = 2x₁ - 3 + 4/x₁²\n\nHmm, okay. So each subsequent equation can be solved similarly. Maybe there's a pattern here. Let's check the second equation:\n\n2x₂³ + 4 = x₂²(x₃ + 3)\n\nAgain, solving for x₃:\n\nx₂²x₃ + 3x₂² - 2x₂³ - 4 = 0\n\nx₂²x₃ = 2x₂³ - 3x₂² + 4\n\nx₃ = (2x₂³ - 3x₂² + 4)/x₂² = 2x₂ - 3 + 4/x₂²\n\nSame structure as x₂ in terms of x₁. So it seems like each xₖ is defined as 2xₖ₋₁ - 3 + 4/xₖ₋₁². If this pattern holds for all variables, then maybe all x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ are equal? Let me test that hypothesis.\n\nSuppose all x₁ = x₂ = ... = xₙ = c. Then each equation becomes:\n\n2c³ + 4 = c²(c + 3)\n\nLet me compute the right-hand side:\n\nc²(c + 3) = c³ + 3c²\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n2c³ + 4 = c³ + 3c²\n\nSubtract c³ + 3c² from both sides:\n\nc³ - 3c² + 4 = 0\n\nSo we have the cubic equation c³ - 3c² + 4 = 0. Let's try to factor this. Maybe rational roots? The possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±4.\n\nTesting c=1: 1 - 3 + 4 = 2 ≠ 0\n\nc= -1: -1 -3 +4=0. Oh, c=-1 is a root. So we can factor (c + 1):\n\nDivide c³ - 3c² + 4 by (c + 1):\n\nUsing polynomial division or synthetic division.\n\nUsing synthetic division for c = -1:\n\n-1 | 1  -3   0    4\n\nBring down the 1.\n\nMultiply by -1: -1\n\nAdd to next coefficient: -3 + (-1) = -4\n\nMultiply by -1: 4\n\nAdd to next coefficient: 0 + 4 = 4\n\nMultiply by -1: -4\n\nAdd to last coefficient: 4 + (-4) = 0. Perfect.\n\nSo the cubic factors as (c + 1)(c² - 4c + 4). Then the quadratic factor is c² -4c +4, which is (c - 2)^2. So the roots are c = -1, c=2 (double root). Therefore, the cubic equation has roots c = -1 and c=2 (twice). \n\nSo if all variables are equal, possible solutions are x₁ = x₂ = ... = xₙ = -1 or x₁ = x₂ = ... = xₙ = 2. But we need to check if these satisfy the original equations.\n\nFirst, check x=2. Let's substitute into the first equation:\n\n2*(2)^3 +4 = 2*(2)^2*(2 + 3)\n\nCompute left side: 2*8 +4 = 16 +4 =20\n\nRight side: 4*(2 +3)=4*5=20. So yes, 20=20. Similarly, all equations would hold if all x_i=2. So x=2 is a solution.\n\nNow check x=-1. Substitute into the first equation:\n\n2*(-1)^3 +4 = 2*(-1)^2*(-1 +3)\n\nLeft side: 2*(-1) +4 = -2 +4=2\n\nRight side: 2*(1)*(2)=4*1=2. So yes, 2=2. Similarly, all equations would hold if all x_i=-1. So x=-1 is also a solution.\n\nTherefore, if all variables are equal, we have two possible solutions: all 2s or all -1s. But the problem states n ≥2, so n can be any integer ≥2. But the user hasn't specified any particular n, so this might be the only solutions. Wait, but maybe there are solutions where variables are not all equal. The problem could have multiple solutions or only these two.\n\nWait, let's test for n=2. Let me check n=2. Then the system is:\n\n2x₁³ +4 = x₁²(x₂ +3)\n\n2x₂³ +4 = x₂²(x₁ +3)\n\nIf x₁=x₂=2, then both equations are satisfied. Similarly, x₁=x₂=-1. Let's check if there are other solutions for n=2.\n\nSuppose n=2. Then we can write:\n\nFrom the first equation: x₂ = (2x₁³ +4)/x₁² -3\n\nSimilarly, from the second equation: x₁ = (2x₂³ +4)/x₂² -3\n\nSo substituting x₂ from the first equation into the second:\n\nx₁ = [2*((2x₁³ +4)/x₁² -3)^3 +4]/[( (2x₁³ +4)/x₁² -3 )²] -3\n\nThis looks very complicated. Maybe there are only the constant solutions? Let's see if x₁=x₂=c satisfies the equations. So as before, c³ -3c² +4=0. Which has roots c=-1,2. So for n=2, the only solutions are all variables equal to -1 or 2.\n\nBut maybe there are solutions where variables alternate? For example, x₁=a, x₂=b, x₁=a, x₂=b. Let's try that.\n\nSuppose the system for n=2 is:\n\nEquation1: 2a³ +4 = a²(b +3)\n\nEquation2: 2b³ +4 = b²(a +3)\n\nLet me try to solve this system. Let's express b from equation1:\n\nb = (2a³ +4)/a² -3 = 2a -3 +4/a²\n\nSubstitute into equation2:\n\n2[(2a -3 +4/a²)^3 +4] = (2a -3 +4/a²)^2 (a +3)\n\nThis seems very messy. Maybe try specific values. If a=2:\n\nThen b=2*2 -3 +4/(2²)=4 -3 +1=2. So b=2. Then substitute into equation2: 2*(2³ +4)/(2²) squared times (2 +3). Wait, let's compute:\n\nLeft side: 2*(8 +4)/(4) = 2*(12)/4=6\n\nRight side: (2²)*(5)=4*5=20. Wait, 6≠20. Hmm, so that doesn't work. Wait, maybe my substitution is wrong.\n\nWait, if a=2, then equation1 gives 2*(8) +4=20, right side is 4*(2 +3)=20. So that works, but then equation2 would be 2*b³ +4 = b²*(2 +3). So if a=2, then equation2 with b=2 is 20=20. So even if a=2, b=2 is a solution. So even if we try to set a=2 and b=2, it works. But if we try a different a, maybe.\n\nSuppose a=1. Then from equation1: 2*1 +4=2*(1)^2*(b +3) => 6=2*(b +3) => b +3=3 => b=0\n\nThen equation2: 2*(0)^3 +4=0²*(1 +3) => 4=0*4=0. That's 4=0, which is false. So a=1 is not a solution.\n\nIf a= -1:\n\nEquation1: 2*(-1)^3 +4=2*(-1)^2*(b +3) => -2 +4=2*(b +3) =>2=2b +6 =>2b= -4 =>b=-2\n\nThen equation2: 2*(-2)^3 +4= (-2)^2*(-1 +3) =>2*(-8) +4=4*(2) =>-16 +4=8 =>-12=8, which is false. So a=-1 doesn't work.\n\nWhat if a=3? Then equation1: 2*27 +4=2*9*(b +3) =>54 +4=18*(b +3) =>58=18b +54 =>18b=4 =>b=4/18=2/9\n\nThen equation2: 2*(2/9)^3 +4=(2/9)^2*(3 +3). Let's compute:\n\nLeft side: 2*(8/729) +4=16/729 +4≈0.0219 +4≈4.0219\n\nRight side: (4/81)*(6)=24/81≈0.2963\n\nNot equal. So that doesn't work. So maybe the only solutions are the constant ones.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that the variables are not all equal. Let's see if there's a non-constant solution for n=2.\n\nAssume x₁ ≠ x₂. Then from equation1: x₂ = (2x₁³ +4)/x₁² -3 = 2x₁ -3 +4/x₁²\n\nFrom equation2: x₁ = (2x₂³ +4)/x₂² -3 = 2x₂ -3 +4/x₂²\n\nSo substituting x₂ from equation1 into equation2:\n\nx₁ = 2*(2x₁ -3 +4/x₁²) -3 +4/( (2x₁ -3 +4/x₁²)^2 )\n\nThis is very complicated. Maybe set t = x₁, then x₂ is a function of t. Then x₁ is also a function of x₂. So we have:\n\nx₁ = 2x₂ -3 +4/x₂²\n\nBut x₂ = 2x₁ -3 +4/x₁²\n\nSo substituting x₂ into the first equation:\n\nx₁ = 2*(2x₁ -3 +4/x₁²) -3 +4/( (2x₁ -3 +4/x₁²)^2 )\n\nThis is a functional equation in x₁. Let's denote f(t) = 2t -3 +4/t². Then x₁ = f(f(x₁)). So we need to solve x₁ = f(f(x₁)).\n\nThis equation might have fixed points, which correspond to solutions where x₁=x₂. But maybe there are other solutions. However, solving this equation seems difficult analytically. Maybe we can check if there are solutions where x₁ and x₂ are different.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that f(f(x₁)) =x₁. Let's try to find fixed points of f(f(x)). Maybe there are other solutions besides the fixed points of f(x).\n\nBut this is getting too complex. Given that for n=2, the only solutions are the constant ones, and the problem allows n ≥2, maybe the only solutions are all variables equal to 2 or -1. But let's check for n=3.\n\nFor n=3, the system is:\n\n2x₁³ +4 =x₁²(x₂ +3)\n\n2x₂³ +4 =x₂²(x₃ +3)\n\n2x₃³ +4 =x₃²(x₁ +3)\n\nAssuming all x_i = c, then c³ -3c² +4=0 as before, so c=2 or c=-1. So for n=3, possible solutions are all 2s or all -1s. But maybe there are other solutions where variables are not all equal.\n\nSuppose we try to set x₁=2, x₂=2, x₃=-1. Let's check if this works.\n\nFirst equation: 2*(8) +4=20, x₁²(x₂ +3)=4*(5)=20. Good.\n\nSecond equation: 2*(8) +4=20, x₂²(x₃ +3)=4*(-1 +3)=8. 20≠8. So that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, try x₁=2, x₂=-1, x₃=2.\n\nFirst equation: 20=4*(-1 +3)=8. 20≠8. Not good.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a cyclic permutation. If x₁=2, then from first equation x₂=2. Then x₃=2, etc. So all variables must be 2. Similarly for -1. So maybe even for n=3, only the constant solutions work.\n\nAlternatively, suppose x₁=2, x₂=2, x₃=2. Then all equations hold. Similarly, if x₁=-1, x₂=-1, x₃=-1. So perhaps no other solutions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are solutions where variables alternate between 2 and -1.

Hmm, let's start by trying to understand the problem better.\n\nFirst, the function f takes any integer k and maps it to a non-negative integer. So f(k) is ≥ 0 for all k ∈ ℤ, and specifically f(0) is a positive integer. The second condition seems like a recurrence relation or something involving superadditive functions, but maybe not. Let me parse it again.\n\n\"For each integer k, the least among the numbers f(k - l) + f(l) for l ∈ ℤ is equal to f(k).\"\n\nSo for each k, the minimum of f(k - l) + f(l) over all integers l is exactly f(k). That sounds like f(k) is the minimal possible value of f(k - l) + f(l) over all l. Let me write that down:\n\nFor all k ∈ ℤ, min_{l ∈ ℤ} [f(k - l) + f(l)] = f(k).\n\nAnd f(0) > 0. So f(0) is some positive integer, but we don't know what. Maybe f(0) is 1? Or maybe it's 2? Wait, the problem says f(0) > 0, so f(0) could be any non-negative integer greater than 0. But the function is defined from ℤ to non-negative integers, so f(0) is at least 1. But maybe the minimal possible f(0) is 1, but we don't know. But perhaps the function must satisfy this condition regardless of the value of f(0). Wait, no, the problem says \"prove that there exists a function f mapping integers to non-negative integers satisfying these two conditions,\" so we need to show that such a function exists, not necessarily find all such functions.\n\nSo the question is, does such a function exist? Let's try to think of possible functions that satisfy these properties.\n\nFirst, let's consider simple functions. For example, if f is a constant function, say f(k) = c for all k, where c is a non-negative integer. Then, for any k, f(k - l) + f(l) = c + c = 2c. So the minimal value would be 2c. But according to the problem, this minimal value should equal f(k) = c. Therefore, 2c = c ⇒ c = 0. But f(0) > 0, so this is impossible. Therefore, constant functions other than f(k) = 0 don't work. But if f(0) = c > 0, then is there a constant function? Wait, no, because as shown, 2c must equal c, which only holds if c = 0, which contradicts f(0) > 0. So constant functions won't work unless c = 0, which violates the first condition.\n\nSo constant functions are out. Let's think of linear functions. Suppose f(k) = a|k| + b for some constants a, b ≥ 0. Then, for any k, f(k - l) + f(l) = a|k - l| + b + a|l| + b = a(|k - l| + |l|) + 2b. The minimal value over l would be when |k - l| + |l| is minimized. The minimal value of |k - l| + |l| is |k|, achieved when l = k/2 if k is even, but since l must be an integer, the minimal is actually |k| when l is between 0 and k. Wait, actually, for any k, the minimal |k - l| + |l| is |k|. For example, take l = k/2 (if k is even), then |k - l| + |l| = |k/2| + |k/2| = |k|/2 + |k|/2 = |k|. If l is not an integer, but l must be integer, so the minimal is |k|. Therefore, the minimal value of f(k - l) + f(l) would be a|k| + 2b. But according to the problem, this should equal f(k) = a|k| + b. Therefore, a|k| + b = a|k| + 2b ⇒ b = 0. But then f(k) = a|k|. So if we take b = 0, then f(k) = a|k|. But then f(0) = 0, which violates the first condition f(0) > 0. So linear functions of the form a|k| don't work either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a piecewise function. Let's consider f(k) = c if k = 0, and f(k) = d for some d ≥ 0 otherwise. But then for k = 0, the minimal value would be min_{l} [f(-l) + f(l)]. Since f(-l) = f(l) = d, so it's min_{l} [d + d] = 2d. But f(0) = c, so 2d = c. So c must be even. But we need to ensure that for other k, say k = 1, the minimal value is d. But let's check. For k = 1, the minimal value over l of f(1 - l) + f(l). Let's take l = 0: f(1) + f(0) = d + c. For l = 1: f(0) + f(1) = c + d. For l = 2: f(-1) + f(2) = d + d = 2d. So the minimal value is min{d + c, c + d, 2d}. But since c = 2d, this becomes min{3d, 3d, 2*2d} = min{3d, 4d} = 3d. But according to the condition, this should equal f(1) = d. So 3d = d ⇒ 2d = 0 ⇒ d = 0. Then c = 0 as well. But f(0) = 0, which is not allowed. Therefore, this piecewise function also doesn't work.\n\nHmm, maybe another approach. Let's think recursively. For each k, f(k) is the minimal value of f(k - l) + f(l) over all l. So f(k) = min_{l} [f(k - l) + f(l)]. Let's try to see if there's a function that satisfies this. Maybe f(k) is the number of times you can add 1 to k before you reach 0. Wait, but that might not fit. Alternatively, think of f(k) as the minimal number of steps needed to reach 0 from k, where each step can be moving left or right by 1, but here the function is defined for all integers, so it's more like a two-sided infinite walk. But in that case, the minimal number of steps is |k|, but that doesn't give us a function satisfying the condition. For example, if f(k) = |k|, then for any k, the minimal f(k - l) + f(l) would be |k - l| + |l|. The minimal value of that over l is min_{l} [|k - l| + |l|]. As before, this is |k|. So if f(k) = |k|, then f(k) = |k| = min_{l} [|k - l| + |l|]. But wait, |k| is equal to the minimal value of |k - l| + |l|, which is |k|, achieved when l is between 0 and k. Therefore, if we define f(k) = |k|, does that satisfy the condition?\n\nWait, let's check. For f(k) = |k|, then for any k, the minimal value of f(k - l) + f(l) over l is |k - l| + |l|. The minimal of that is |k|, which equals f(k). So yes, this function satisfies the second condition. But wait, f(0) = 0, which violates the first condition f(0) > 0. Therefore, this doesn't work. But maybe if we adjust f(0) to be some positive integer. Suppose f(k) = |k| + c for all k, where c is a non-negative integer. Then f(0) = c > 0. Let's check the second condition. For any k, the minimal value of |k - l| + |l| + c. The minimal value of |k - l| + |l| is |k|, so the minimal value becomes |k| + c. But f(k) = |k| + c, so indeed, the minimal value is f(k). Therefore, if we define f(k) = |k| + c for some constant c ≥ 0, then this function satisfies both conditions. But wait, the problem says \"prove that there exists a function f mapping integers to non-negative integers satisfying these two conditions\". So if we can choose c ≥ 0, then yes, such a function exists. But maybe the problem expects f(0) > 0, so c must be at least 1. Therefore, such a function exists. For example, take c = 1, so f(k) = |k| + 1. Then f(0) = 1 > 0, and for any k, the minimal value is |k| + 1 = f(k). Wait, no, wait. Let's check again. Wait, if f(k) = |k| + c, then the minimal value of f(k - l) + f(l) would be |k - l| + c + |l| + c = |k - l| + |l| + 2c. The minimal value of |k - l| + |l| is |k|, so the minimal value here is |k| + 2c. But f(k) = |k| + c, so |k| + 2c should equal |k| + c ⇒ c = 0. But f(0) = |0| + c = c > 0, so c must be at least 1. Therefore, this doesn't work. Therefore, my previous thought was wrong. If I define f(k) = |k| + c, then the minimal value is |k| + 2c, which must equal |k| + c, so c = 0, which is invalid. Therefore, this approach doesn't work.\n\nSo perhaps the function f(k) = |k| + 1, but then the minimal value would be |k| + 2, which is greater than f(k) = |k| + 1. So that doesn't satisfy the condition. Therefore, maybe the function must be something else.\n\nWait, but when I first considered f(k) = |k|, the minimal value was |k|, which equals f(k). So if we set c = 0, then f(k) = |k|, but f(0) = 0 is invalid. So maybe we need to adjust the function for non-zero k. Wait, but the problem allows f(0) to be any positive integer, not necessarily 1. So maybe we can define f(k) = |k| + c, but then as we saw, it doesn't work unless c = 0. Alternatively, maybe f(k) = |k|. Then f(0) = 0, which is invalid. So perhaps there's no solution. But the problem says \"prove that there exists a function\", so maybe there is a solution.\n\nWait, maybe the function is constant. Wait, but constant functions don't work unless they are zero. Since f(0) > 0, so if f(k) = c for all k, then c must be 0, which is invalid. So constant functions don't work.\n\nWait, maybe f(k) = 1 for all k. Let's check. Then, for any k, the minimal value of f(k - l) + f(l) is min{1 + 1} = 2. But f(k) = 1, so 2 ≠ 1. So that doesn't work. Similarly, any constant function other than zero won't work because the minimal value would be 2c, which needs to equal c, leading to c=0. So constant functions are out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe f(k) is something like the ceiling of k/2 + 1. Wait, let's test. Suppose f(k) = ceil(k/2) + 1. Then f(0) = 0 + 1 = 1 > 0. Let's check for k = 1. The minimal value of f(1 - l) + f(l) over l. For l = 0: f(1) + f(0) = ceil(1/2) + 1 + ceil(0/2) + 1 = 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3. For l = 1: f(0) + f(1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. For l = 2: but l must be integer. So minimal value is 3. But f(1) = 1 + 1 = 2. So 3 ≠ 2, which violates the condition. So this function doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe f(k) is the number of ones in the binary representation of k, but I don't think that would satisfy the condition.\n\nWait, let's think recursively. Suppose we define f(k) such that for each k, f(k) is the minimal value of f(k - l) + f(l). Let's try to build such a function. Let's start with f(0) = c > 0. Then, for k = 1, f(1) is the minimal of f(1 - l) + f(l) over all integers l. Let's take l = 0: f(1) + f(0) = f(1) + c. For l = 1: f(0) + f(1) = c + f(1). For l = 2: f(-1) + f(2). So the minimal value is min{f(1) + c, c + f(1), f(-1) + f(2)}. But f(-1) = f(1) if we mirror the function, but we don't know that. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify whether the function is symmetric. So maybe we need to define it asymmetrically.\n\nBut perhaps we can choose f(k) such that it's symmetric. Let's assume f(k) = f(-k) for all k. Then, for even k, l can range around 0, but for odd k, the l's that are in between would", "answer": "Udowodnijmy, że takiej funkcji nie ma.
