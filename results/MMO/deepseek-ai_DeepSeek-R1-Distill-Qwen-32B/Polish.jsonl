Then Lolek draws two rays from each point: one vertical and one horizontal. The goal is to figure out the maximum integer k such that Lolek can always get at least k regions, no matter how Bolek places the points.\n\nHmm, let me try to visualize this. Each point has a horizontal and vertical ray. So, for each point, these rays will extend infinitely in one direction. Since the points aren't aligned vertically or horizontally, each horizontal ray from a point won't overlap with another horizontal ray, and similarly for vertical rays.\n\nI think the key here is to figure out how these rays divide the plane. Each horizontal ray can potentially split existing regions, and the same with vertical rays. But since they're rays, not full lines, their impact might be different.\n\nLet me start with small n to see a pattern.\n\nCase n=1: 2 points. Each point has a horizontal and vertical ray. So, for each point, the horizontal ray will go either left or right, and the vertical ray will go either up or down. But since the points aren't aligned, their rays won't interfere with each other in a way that would reduce the number of regions.\n\nWait, actually, for n=1, 2 points. Let's say point A and point B. Each has a horizontal and vertical ray. Depending on the direction of the rays, the number of regions can vary. But Lolek wants to maximize the regions, so he can choose the direction of the rays to maximize the divisions.\n\nIf Lolek draws all horizontal rays to the right and all vertical rays upwards, then each horizontal ray will split the plane into more regions. Similarly, each vertical ray will do the same.\n\nBut wait, for two points, how many regions do we get? Let's think.\n\nEach horizontal ray from a point will divide the plane into two parts: left and right of the ray. Similarly, each vertical ray will divide into top and bottom. But since the rays are from different points, their intersections can create more regions.\n\nWait, actually, each horizontal ray can intersect with vertical rays from other points, but since the points aren't aligned, each horizontal ray from one point can intersect with vertical rays from other points, but not with the horizontal rays.\n\nWait, no, horizontal and vertical rays can intersect each other. So, for two points, each with a horizontal and vertical ray, how many intersections are there?\n\nEach horizontal ray from one point can intersect with vertical rays from the other point. So, for two points, each has one horizontal and one vertical ray. So, the horizontal ray from point A can intersect with the vertical ray from point B, and vice versa. So, each pair of points contributes two intersections.\n\nBut how does that affect the number of regions?\n\nI remember that in planar arrangements, the maximum number of regions created by lines is given by the formula R = (n^2 + n + 2)/2, but that's for lines. Here, we have rays, which are like half-lines, so maybe the formula is different.\n\nWait, actually, each ray can be thought of as a line that starts at a point and goes to infinity. So, each horizontal ray is like a horizontal line starting at a point, and each vertical ray is a vertical line starting at a point.\n\nSo, for each point, we have two rays: horizontal and vertical. So, for 2n points, we have 2n horizontal rays and 2n vertical rays.\n\nBut since the points are in general position (no two on the same horizontal or vertical line), each horizontal ray from a point will not overlap with any other horizontal ray, and same for vertical.\n\nSo, the arrangement of these rays is similar to an arrangement of horizontal and vertical lines, but each line is only a ray starting at a point.\n\nHmm, so how does this affect the number of regions?\n\nIn the case of full lines, the number of regions formed by m horizontal lines and n vertical lines is (m+1)(n+1). But here, since they are rays, each horizontal ray only extends in one direction, say to the right, and each vertical ray extends upwards.\n\nWait, but Lolek can choose the direction of the rays. So, to maximize the number of regions, he should choose directions such that each ray extends into a different quadrant.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nIf all horizontal rays go to the right and all vertical rays go up, then each horizontal ray will intersect with all vertical rays from points to its left. Similarly, each vertical ray will intersect with all horizontal rays from points below it.\n\nBut since the points are in general position, each horizontal ray from a point will intersect with all vertical rays from points that are to the left of it. Similarly, each vertical ray will intersect with all horizontal rays from points below it.\n\nSo, the number of intersections would be the number of pairs of points where one is to the left and below the other.\n\nWait, but how does that translate to regions?\n\nI think the number of regions can be calculated by considering the arrangement of these rays. Each new ray can potentially add as many regions as the number of intersections it has with existing rays plus one.\n\nBut since we have two sets of rays: horizontal and vertical, maybe we can model this as a grid.\n\nWait, if all horizontal rays go to the right and all vertical rays go up, then the arrangement is similar to a grid where each horizontal ray starts at a point and goes right, and each vertical ray starts at a point and goes up.\n\nIn such a case, the number of regions would be similar to the number of cells in a grid, but since the rays are not full lines, the regions might be different.\n\nWait, actually, each horizontal ray can intersect with multiple vertical rays, and each intersection creates a new region.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to model this as a planar graph where each intersection is a vertex, and each segment between intersections is an edge, and the regions are the faces.\n\nBut maybe I can find a formula for the maximum number of regions.\n\nWait, let's think about it step by step.\n\nSuppose we have m horizontal rays and m vertical rays. Each horizontal ray can intersect with each vertical ray, but only if they are from different points.\n\nWait, no, each horizontal ray from a point can intersect with vertical rays from other points, but not with its own vertical ray.\n\nSo, for each horizontal ray, it can intersect with (m - 1) vertical rays, since it can't intersect with its own vertical ray.\n\nSimilarly, each vertical ray can intersect with (m - 1) horizontal rays.\n\nBut wait, in our case, m is 2n, since we have 2n points, each contributing one horizontal and one vertical ray.\n\nSo, each horizontal ray can intersect with (2n - 1) vertical rays, but actually, no, because the vertical rays are from other points, but depending on their positions, some might not intersect.\n\nWait, no, since the points are in general position, meaning no two share the same x or y coordinate, so each horizontal ray from a point will intersect with all vertical rays from points that are to the left of it.\n\nSimilarly, each vertical ray will intersect with all horizontal rays from points below it.\n\nSo, the number of intersections is equal to the number of pairs of points where one is to the left and below the other.\n\nWait, that's similar to counting the number of such pairs, which is the number of inversions in a permutation, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each point, the number of vertical rays it intersects with is equal to the number of points to its left, and the number of horizontal rays it intersects with is equal to the number of points below it.\n\nBut since the points are in general position, we can order them by their x-coordinates and y-coordinates.\n\nLet me try to model this.\n\nSuppose we sort the points by their x-coordinates. For each point, the number of points to its left is its index minus one. Similarly, if we sort them by y-coordinates, the number of points below it is its index minus one.\n\nBut since the points are in general position, the x and y orderings are independent.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the number of intersections.\n\nEach horizontal ray from a point will intersect with all vertical rays from points that are to the left of it. Similarly, each vertical ray will intersect with all horizontal rays from points below it.\n\nSo, the total number of intersections is the sum over all points of the number of points to the left of it (for horizontal rays) plus the number of points below it (for vertical rays). But wait, no, each intersection is counted once, so maybe it's the sum over all points of the number of points to the left of it, which is the same as the sum over all points of the number of points below it, because of the general position.\n\nWait, actually, the total number of intersections is equal to the number of pairs of points where one is to the left and below the other. So, if we have 2n points, the number of such pairs is the number of inversions in the permutation when sorted by x and y coordinates.\n\nBut since the points are in general position, the number of such pairs can vary, but Lolek wants to maximize the number of regions regardless of the point positions. So, he needs a strategy that works for any configuration.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"niezależnie od położenia punktów\", which means \"independently of the points' positions\". So, Lolek has to choose the directions of the rays in such a way that regardless of how Bolek placed the points, the number of regions is at least k. So, we need the minimal maximum, i.e., the maximum k such that no matter how the points are placed, Lolek can choose the directions to get at least k regions.\n\nSo, we need to find the minimal number of regions that Lolek can guarantee, regardless of the point configuration.\n\nWait, but how does the direction of the rays affect the number of regions? If Lolek can choose the direction of each ray (left/right for horizontal, up/down for vertical), he can arrange them in a way that maximizes the number of intersections, thereby maximizing the regions.\n\nBut since the points are given, he can choose directions to make as many intersections as possible.\n\nWait, but the problem is to find the maximum k such that Lolek can always get at least k regions, regardless of the point positions. So, we need the minimal number of regions that Lolek can always achieve, no matter how the points are placed.\n\nWait, no, actually, it's the maximum k such that Lolek can always get at least k regions. So, regardless of how Bolek places the points, Lolek can choose the directions to get at least k regions. So, we need the minimal upper bound on the number of regions that Lolek can always achieve, regardless of the point configuration.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the minimal number of regions that Lolek can force, regardless of the point positions.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Let me try to think differently.\n\nEach point contributes two rays: horizontal and vertical. The direction of each ray can be chosen by Lolek. So, for each point, he can choose whether the horizontal ray goes left or right, and the vertical ray goes up or down.\n\nTo maximize the number of regions, he should arrange the rays such that each ray intersects as many rays from other points as possible.\n\nBut since the points are in general position, the number of intersections depends on the directions chosen.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of regions is achieved when all horizontal rays go in one direction (say, right) and all vertical rays go in one direction (say, up). But depending on the point positions, this might not always be the case.\n\nWait, no, because if all horizontal rays go right, then for a point, the horizontal ray will only intersect with vertical rays from points to its left. Similarly, if all vertical rays go up, they will only intersect with horizontal rays from points below.\n\nBut since the points are in general position, the number of such intersections can vary.\n\nWait, but Lolek can choose the direction of each ray individually. So, for each point, he can choose the direction of the horizontal and vertical rays to maximize the number of intersections.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, for each point, if he chooses the horizontal ray to go to the right, it will intersect with all vertical rays from points to its left. If he chooses it to go to the left, it will intersect with all vertical rays from points to its right.\n\nSimilarly, for the vertical ray, choosing up will intersect with horizontal rays from points below, and choosing down will intersect with horizontal rays from points above.\n\nSo, for each point, Lolek can choose the direction of the horizontal and vertical rays to maximize the number of intersections.\n\nBut since he wants to maximize the total number of regions, he should choose directions such that each ray intersects as many rays from other points as possible.\n\nBut since the points are given, he can choose the direction for each ray to intersect the maximum number of rays from other points.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the points are given, and Lolek has to choose the directions without knowing their positions. Wait, no, Lolek can see the points and choose the directions accordingly. So, he can choose the directions based on the positions of the points.\n\nSo, for each point, he can choose the direction of the horizontal and vertical rays to maximize the number of intersections.\n\nTherefore, for each point, he can choose the direction of the horizontal ray to go towards the side where there are more points, and similarly for the vertical ray.\n\nBut since the points are in general position, for each point, the number of points to the left and right can be different, and similarly for above and below.\n\nBut since Lolek wants to maximize the number of intersections, he can choose the direction of the horizontal ray to go towards the side with more points, and similarly for the vertical ray.\n\nBut since the points are in general position, for each point, the number of points to the left and right can be anything, but on average, it's n-1 on each side, since there are 2n points.\n\nWait, but actually, for each point, the number of points to the left and right can vary. For example, a point could be the leftmost, so all other points are to its right.\n\nBut Lolek can choose the direction of the horizontal ray to go towards the side with more points, thereby maximizing the number of intersections.\n\nSimilarly for the vertical ray.\n\nBut since the points are in general position, for each point, the number of points to the left and right can be anything, but Lolek can choose the direction to maximize the number of intersections.\n\nWait, but the problem is to find the minimal k such that regardless of the point configuration, Lolek can get at least k regions.\n\nSo, we need to find the minimal number of regions that Lolek can always achieve, regardless of how the points are placed.\n\nWait, no, the problem says \"narysowane półproste podzieliły płaszczyznę na jak najwięcej obszarów.

Hmm, interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem. I need to assign either a +1 or -1 to each coefficient from 1 to n, and when I multiply each coefficient by its assigned +1 or -1 and sum them all up, the total should be zero. So, for example, if n is 1, then the sum is just \\( 1 \\cdot s_1 \\), which can be either 1 or -1, neither of which is zero. So n=1 is out.\n\nWhat about n=2? Let's see. The sum would be \\( 1 \\cdot s_1 + 2 \\cdot s_2 \\). The possible sums are:\n\n- If both s1 and s2 are 1: 1 + 2 = 3\n- If s1 is 1 and s2 is -1: 1 - 2 = -1\n- If s1 is -1 and s2 is 1: -1 + 2 = 1\n- If both are -1: -1 - 2 = -3\n\nNone of these are zero, so n=2 is also not possible.\n\nMoving on to n=3. The sum is \\( 1s_1 + 2s_2 + 3s_3 \\). Let's see if we can get zero.\n\nLet me try different combinations:\n\n1. All positive: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6\n2. Flip s3: 1 + 2 - 3 = 0. Oh, that works! So for n=3, it's possible. So n=3 is a solution.\n\nWait, so n=3 works. Let me note that down.\n\nNow, n=4. Let's see if it's possible. The sum is \\( 1s_1 + 2s_2 + 3s_3 + 4s_4 \\). The total sum without any signs is 1+2+3+4=10. So the maximum possible sum is 10, and the minimum is -10. We need a sum of zero.\n\nBut wait, the total sum is 10, which is even. If we can partition the numbers 1,2,3,4 into two subsets with equal sums, then it's possible. Because assigning +1 to one subset and -1 to the other would give a total sum of zero.\n\nSo, the total sum is 10, so each subset should sum to 5. Let's see if we can find such a partition.\n\nLooking for a subset of {1,2,3,4} that adds up to 5.\n\nPossible subsets:\n\n- 1 and 4: 1+4=5\n- 2 and 3: 2+3=5\n\nYes, so we can assign s1=1, s4=1, and s2=-1, s3=-1. Then the sum would be 1 - 2 - 3 + 4 = 0. So n=4 works.\n\nWait, let me check that: 1 - 2 - 3 + 4 = (1 + 4) - (2 + 3) = 5 - 5 = 0. Yep, that works. So n=4 is also a solution.\n\nMoving on to n=5. The total sum is 1+2+3+4+5=15. To get a sum of zero, we need to partition the numbers into two subsets with equal sums, but 15 is odd. So it's impossible because you can't split an odd number into two equal integers. Therefore, n=5 is not possible.\n\nWait, but hold on. The total sum is 15, which is odd. So the difference between the two subsets would have to be zero, meaning each subset would have to sum to 7.5, which isn't possible because we're dealing with integers. So yes, n=5 is out.\n\nn=6. The total sum is 1+2+3+4+5+6=21. Again, 21 is odd, so same problem as n=5. We can't split 21 into two equal integer subsets. So n=6 is also not possible.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me think again. The total sum is 21, which is odd, so it's impossible to have a subset sum of 10.5, which isn't an integer. So n=6 is out.\n\nn=7. The total sum is 28. 28 is even, so maybe possible. Let's see if we can partition the numbers 1 through 7 into two subsets each summing to 14.\n\nIs there a subset of {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} that adds up to 14?\n\nLet me try:\n\nStart with the largest number, 7. 14 -7=7. So we need a subset that adds up to 7 from the remaining numbers.\n\nLooking for a subset in {1,2,3,4,5,6} that adds to 7.\n\nPossible:\n\n- 6 +1=7\n- 5 +2=7\n- 4 +3=7\n- 1+2+4=7\n\nSo yes, multiple ways. For example, take 7 and 6 and 1: 7+6+1=14. So assign s7=1, s6=1, s1=1, and the rest as -1. Let's check:\n\n1 + 2*(-1) + 3*(-1) + 4*(-1) + 5*(-1) + 6 + 7 = 1 -2 -3 -4 -5 +6 +7.\n\nCalculating: 1 -2= -1; -1 -3= -4; -4 -4= -8; -8 -5= -13; -13 +6= -7; -7 +7=0. Perfect.\n\nSo n=7 works.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The total sum is 28, so each subset should be 14. So yes, n=7 is possible.\n\nn=8. Total sum is 36. 36 is even, so each subset should be 18.\n\nCan we partition 1 through 8 into two subsets each summing to 18?\n\nLet me try:\n\nStart with 8. 18 -8=10. So need a subset from 1-7 that sums to 10.\n\nLooking for a subset in 1-7 that adds to 10.\n\nPossible:\n\n- 7 +3=10\n- 6 +4=10\n- 5 +4 +1=10\n- 5 +3 +2=10\n- 6 +3 +1=10\n\nSo yes, for example, take 8,7,3: 8+7+3=18. Assign s8=1, s7=1, s3=1, and the rest as -1.\n\nLet me check:\n\n1*(-1) + 2*(-1) + 3 + 4*(-1) +5*(-1) +6*(-1) +7 +8.\n\nCalculating: -1 -2 +3 -4 -5 -6 +7 +8.\n\n-1-2=-3; -3+3=0; 0-4=-4; -4-5=-9; -9-6=-15; -15+7=-8; -8+8=0. Perfect.\n\nSo n=8 works.\n\nn=9. Total sum is 45, which is odd. So can't split into two equal subsets. Therefore, n=9 is out.\n\nn=10. Total sum is 55, which is odd. So same issue as n=5,7,9. Can't split into two equal subsets. So n=10 is out.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me think again. For n=10, the total sum is 55, which is odd, so it's impossible to have a subset sum of 27.5, which isn't an integer. So n=10 is out.\n\nn=11. Total sum is 66, which is even. So each subset should be 33.\n\nCan we partition 1 through 11 into two subsets each summing to 33?\n\nLet me try:\n\nStart with 11. 33 -11=22. So need a subset from 1-10 that sums to 22.\n\nLooking for a subset in 1-10 that adds to 22.\n\nPossible:\n\n- 10 +9 +3=22\n- 10 +8 +4=22\n- 9 +8 +5=22\n- 10 +7 +5=22\n- 9 +7 +6=22\n- 8 +7 +6 +1=22\n- etc.\n\nSo yes, for example, take 11,10,9,3: 11+10+9+3=33. Assign s11=1, s10=1, s9=1, s3=1, and the rest as -1.\n\nLet me check:\n\n1*(-1) + 2*(-1) + 3 +4*(-1)+5*(-1)+6*(-1)+7*(-1)+8*(-1)+9 +10 +11.\n\nCalculating: -1 -2 +3 -4 -5 -6 -7 -8 +9 +10 +11.\n\n-1-2=-3; -3+3=0; 0-4=-4; -4-5=-9; -9-6=-15; -15-7=-22; -22-8=-30; -30+9=-21; -21+10=-11; -11+11=0. Perfect.\n\nSo n=11 works.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The total sum is 66, so each subset should be 33. So yes, n=11 is possible.\n\nn=12. Total sum is 78, which is even. Each subset should be 39.\n\nCan we partition 1 through 12 into two subsets each summing to 39?\n\nLet me try:\n\nStart with 12. 39 -12=27. So need a subset from 1-11 that sums to 27.\n\nLooking for a subset in 1-11 that adds to 27.\n\nPossible:\n\n- 11 +10 +6=27\n- 11 +9 +7=27\n- 10 +9 +8=27\n- 11 +8 +7 +1=27\n- etc.\n\nSo yes, for example, take 12,11,10,6: 12+11+10+6=39. Assign s12=1, s11=1, s10=1, s6=1, and the rest as -1.\n\nLet me check:\n\n1*(-1) + 2*(-1) +3*(-1)+4*(-1)+5*(-1)+6 +7*(-1)+8*(-1)+9*(-1)+10 +11 +12.\n\nCalculating: -1 -2 -3 -4 -5 +6 -7 -8 -9 +10 +11 +12.\n\n-1-2=-3; -3-3=-6; -6-4=-10; -10-5=-15; -15+6=-9; -9-7=-16; -16-8=-24; -24-9=-33; -33+10=-23; -23+11=-12; -12+12=0. Perfect.\n\nSo n=12 works.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The total sum is 78, so each subset should be 39. So yes, n=12 is possible.\n\nHmm, so far, the pattern seems to be that for n=3,4,7,8,11,12, etc., it's possible. Let me see if there's a pattern here.\n\nLooking at the numbers: 3,4,7,8,11,12,...\n\nIt seems like starting from n=3, every number that is congruent to 0 or 3 modulo 4? Wait, let's check:\n\nn=3: 3 mod4=3\n\nn=4: 4 mod4=0\n\nn=7:7 mod4=3\n\nn=8:8 mod4=0\n\nn=11:11 mod4=3\n\nn=12:12 mod4=0\n\nYes, so it's numbers where n ≡0 or 3 mod4.\n\nWait, but let me check n=15. Total sum is 120, which is even. Each subset should be 60.\n\nCan we partition 1 through 15 into two subsets each summing to 60?\n\nYes, because 15 is a triangular number, and 15 is 3 mod4. So it should be possible.\n\nBut let me think about the general case.\n\nThe total sum S = n(n+1)/2. For the sum to be zero, S must be even, because we need to split it into two equal subsets. So S must be even, which means n(n+1)/2 must be even.\n\nSo n(n+1) must be divisible by 4.\n\nBecause n and n+1 are consecutive integers, one of them is even. For their product to be divisible by 4, either n or n+1 must be divisible by 4.\n\nSo, n ≡0 mod4 or n≡3 mod4.\n\nBecause:\n\nIf n is even, then n must be divisible by 4.\n\nIf n is odd, then n+1 must be divisible by 4, so n ≡3 mod4.\n\nTherefore, the condition is that n ≡0 or 3 mod4.\n\nSo, all positive integers n where n ≡0 or 3 mod4.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with n=3: 3≡3 mod4, works.\n\nn=4:4≡0 mod4, works.\n\nn=7:7≡3 mod4, works.\n\nn=8:8≡0 mod4, works.\n\nn=11:11≡3 mod4, works.\n\nn", "answer": "**(Powyższe równości wynikają ze wzoru na sumę ciągu arytmetycznego.)**  \n**Stąd**  \n\\[\nA - B + C = k \\cdot \\left( \\frac{k - 1}{2} - (4k - 1) + \\frac{7k - 1}{2} \\right) = 0.\n\\]\n\n**Jeżeli \\( n = 4k \\) dla pewnego \\( k = 1, 2, \\ldots \\), to możemy wybrać**  \n\\[\ns_i = \n\\begin{cases} \n1 & \\text{dla } i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, k, 3k + 1, 3k + 2, \\ldots, 4k\\}, \\\\ \n-1 & \\text{dla } i \\in \\{k + 1, k + 2, \\ldots, 3k\\}.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n**Analogicznie jak wyżej widzimy, że**  \n\\[\n1 \\cdot s_1 + 2 \\cdot s_2 + \\ldots + n \\cdot s_n = A - B + C,\n\\]\n\n**gdzie**  \n\\[\nA = 1 + 2 + \\ldots + k = \\frac{k(k + 1)}{2},\n\\]  \n\\[\nB = (k + 1) + (k + 2) + \\ldots + 3k = \\frac{2k(4k + 1)}{2} = k(4k + 1),\n\\]  \n\\[\nC = (3k + 1) + (3k + 2) + \\ldots + 4k = \\frac{k(7k + 1)}{2}.\n\\]\n\n**Stąd**  \n\\[\nA - B + C = k \\cdot \\left( \\frac{k + 1}{2} - (4k + 1) + \\frac{7k + 1}{2} \\right) = 0.\n\\]  "}

When I subtracted Equation (1) from Equation (2), I got \\( (c - a)(c + a + 4b) = 0 \\), leading to two cases. The first case, c = a, led to no solution because it resulted in a negative square. The second case, c = -a -4b, led us to b = 0, and then a = ±1, c = ∓1.\n\nIs there any other possibility? Did I miss any cases?\n\nWell, in the first case, c = a led to no solution, so the only possible case is c = -a -4b, which led us to b = 0, and then the solutions above.\n\nTherefore, these are the only real solutions.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe real triples are \\(\\boxed{(1, 0, -1)}\\) and \\(\\boxed{(-1, 0, 1)}\\).\n</think>\n\nWe need to find all triples of real numbers \\((a, b, c)\\) that satisfy the system of equations:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases} \na^2 + 4ab + b^2 = 1 \\\\ \nb^2 + 4bc + c^2 = 1 \\\\ \nc^2 + 4ca + a^2 = -2 \n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nFirst, we subtract the first equation from the second:\n\n\\[\n(b^2 + 4bc + c^2) - (a^2 + 4ab + b^2) = 0\n\\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n\\[\n4bc + c^2 - a^2 - 4ab = 0\n\\]\n\nFactoring, we have:\n\n\\[\n(c - a)(c + a + 4b) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us two cases: \\(c = a\\) or \\(c + a + 4b = 0\\).\n\n**Case 1: \\(c = a\\)**\n\nSubstituting \\(c = a\\) into the third equation:\n\n\\[\na^2 + 4a^2 + a^2 = -2 \\implies 6a^2 = -2\n\\]\n\nThis leads to a contradiction since \\(a^2\\) cannot be negative.

The condition is that in every m×n or n×m rectangle, each number from A appears exactly once. Hmm, that sounds a bit like a Latin square but extended to an infinite grid. Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I know that a Latin square is an n×n grid filled with n different symbols, each appearing exactly once in each row and column. But here, the grid is infinite, and the rectangles can be m×n or n×m. So, it's a bit different. Maybe it's related to something called a \"Latin rectangle\" or a \"Latin grid\"?\n\nWait, the problem says that in every m×n or n×m rectangle, each number from A appears exactly once. So, for any such rectangle, it's like a Latin rectangle of size m×n. But since the grid is infinite, this has to hold for every possible m×n or n×m rectangle anywhere on the grid. That seems pretty restrictive.\n\nLet me think about small cases. Maybe starting with m=1 or n=1. If m=1, then the set A would be {1, 2, ..., n}. So, the grid is infinite, and every 1×n or n×1 rectangle must contain each number exactly once. But a 1×n rectangle is just a row of n cells, so each row must be a permutation of {1, 2, ..., n}. Similarly, each column must also be a permutation of {1, 2, ..., n} because of the n×1 rectangles. So, this is essentially an infinite Latin square where each row and column is a permutation of {1, 2, ..., n}. I know that such squares exist for any n, like repeating a finite Latin square infinitely. So, for m=1, any n is possible? Wait, but the problem says positive integers, so m and n are at least 1. So, (1, n) for any n is a possible pair.\n\nSimilarly, if n=1, then A = {1, 2, ..., m}, and the grid must have each m×1 or 1×m rectangle containing each number exactly once. So, similar reasoning: each column must be a permutation of {1, 2, ..., m}, and each row must be a permutation as well. So, (m, 1) is also possible for any m.\n\nBut what about when both m and n are greater than 1? Let's try m=2 and n=2. Then A = {1, 2, 3, 4}. We need every 2×2 square to contain each number exactly once. So, it's like a toroidal Latin square, where the pattern repeats every 2 rows and 2 columns. For example, a 2x2 Latin square can be:\n\n1 2\n2 1\n\nBut if we tile this infinitely, then every 2x2 block will have each number exactly once. So, (2,2) is possible.\n\nWhat about m=2 and n=3? Then A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. We need every 2x3 or 3x2 rectangle to contain each number exactly once. Hmm, is that possible? Let me try to construct such a grid.\n\nIf I think of a 2x3 Latin rectangle, it's a 2x3 grid where each number 1-6 appears exactly once. But since the grid is infinite, we need a repeating pattern. Maybe using a toroidal approach where the pattern repeats every 2 rows and 3 columns. But wait, in a 2x3 grid, each row must contain 3 distinct numbers, and each column must contain 2 distinct numbers. But since the entire grid is infinite, the arrangement must be such that every 2x3 window is a Latin rectangle.\n\nWait, but in a 2x3 grid, each number must appear exactly once in each 2x3 block. So, the entire grid must be a tiling of 2x3 Latin rectangles without overlapping. But I'm not sure if such a tiling is possible. Maybe it's related to a Graeco-Latin square or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the grid can be constructed using a repeating pattern where each 2x3 block is a permutation. But I'm not sure. Let me think about the necessary conditions.\n\nFor such a grid to exist, the arrangement must be periodic with periods m and n in rows and columns, respectively. So, the grid is a tiling of m×n blocks, each of which is a Latin rectangle. But for the entire grid to satisfy the condition, the overlapping blocks must also satisfy the condition. So, the arrangement must be such that when you shift by one row or column, the new block still contains all numbers exactly once.\n\nThis seems similar to a de Bruijn sequence but in two dimensions. Maybe it's related to a torus. Wait, if the grid is toroidal, meaning it wraps around, then it's possible to have such a tiling. But the problem is about an infinite grid, not a torus, so wrapping around isn't an option. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the grid can be constructed using a finite Latin square that repeats. For example, if m and n are coprime, maybe it's possible to tile the grid in such a way. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's think about the necessary conditions. For the grid to have every m×n rectangle contain each number exactly once, the arrangement must be such that in every direction, the numbers repeat in a way that doesn't cause duplicates in any m×n window.\n\nThis reminds me of a concept called a \"perfect map\" or \"perfect tiling.\" Maybe it's related to the idea of a grid where each m×n block is a Latin rectangle, and the entire grid is a tiling of these blocks without overlapping.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact conditions. Maybe I should look for known results. I recall that such grids are possible when m and n are coprime, but I'm not certain.\n\nWait, let's think about the case when m=2 and n=3. If I try to construct a grid where every 2x3 block is a Latin rectangle, I might run into issues. For example, in the first 2x3 block, I have numbers 1-6 arranged so that each row has 3 distinct numbers and each column has 2 distinct numbers. Then, when I move one column to the right, the next 2x3 block must also have all numbers 1-6, but overlapping with the previous block. This might cause conflicts because the overlapping columns would have to maintain the uniqueness.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's possible if the grid is constructed using a finite field or something. For example, if m and n are powers of primes, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: if the grid is a torus, then it's possible to have such a tiling if m and n are coprime. But since the grid is infinite, not toroidal, maybe the same conditions apply. So, perhaps m and n must be coprime.\n\nWait, let's test m=2 and n=2. They are not coprime, but we saw that it's possible. So, maybe coprimality isn't a necessary condition. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the grid can be constructed if and only if m and n are both 1, or one of them is 1. But that contradicts the m=2, n=2 case.\n\nWait, no, because when m=2 and n=2, it's possible. So, maybe the condition is that m and n are both 1, or one of them is 1, or both are equal to 2. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nWait, let's think about the necessary conditions. For the grid to have every m×n rectangle contain each number exactly once, the arrangement must be such that in every row, the numbers repeat every n columns, and in every column, the numbers repeat every m rows. So, the grid is periodic with period n in columns and period m in rows.\n\nBut for this to work, the periods must align such that the overlapping blocks don't cause duplicates. So, maybe m and n must be such that their least common multiple is mn, which is always true, but that doesn't give any restriction.\n\nWait, no, the least common multiple of m and n is mn only if m and n are coprime. So, if m and n are coprime, then the periods don't interfere, and the tiling can be done without overlaps causing duplicates. But if they are not coprime, then the overlapping might cause duplicates.\n\nWait, let's test m=2 and n=2. They are not coprime, but we saw that it's possible. So, maybe coprimality isn't a necessary condition. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the grid can be constructed if and only if m and n are both 1, or one of them is 1, or both are equal to 2. But that seems too restrictive.\n\nWait, another thought: if m and n are both 1, it's trivial. If one of them is 1, it's a Latin square in one dimension, which is possible. If both are 2, it's possible as we saw. What about m=3 and n=3? Then A = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}. We need every 3x3 square to contain each number exactly once. That's essentially a Sudoku grid extended infinitely. But Sudoku grids are finite, and extending them infinitely without repeating patterns is non-trivial. I don't think it's possible because the constraints are too tight. Each 3x3 block must be a Latin square, but overlapping blocks would require the same number to appear in multiple places, which might not be possible.\n\nWait, but in Sudoku, the entire grid is a Latin square, but each 3x3 block is also a Latin square. However, Sudoku is finite, and the infinite version might not be possible because you can't have an infinite Sudoku without repeating patterns. So, maybe m=3 and n=3 is not possible.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the grid is infinite, and every m×n rectangle must be a Latin rectangle. So, for m=3 and n=3, it's like an infinite Sudoku grid, which I don't think exists because of the overlapping constraints.\n\nSo, maybe the only possible pairs are when m=1, n=1, or one of them is 1, or both are 2. Wait, but m=2 and n=2 is possible, but m=3 and n=3 is not. So, perhaps the only possible pairs are (1, n), (n, 1), and (2,2).\n\nWait, but let's think again about m=2 and n=3. If I try to construct such a grid, maybe it's possible. Let me try to create a 2x3 block:\n\n1 2 3\n4 5 6\n\nThen, to the right, the next 2x3 block should be a permutation of 1-6, but shifted in some way. Maybe:\n\n4 5 6\n1 2 3\n\nBut then, the overlapping 2x3 block starting at column 2 would be:\n\n2 3 4\n5 6 1\n\nWhich contains numbers 1-6, so that's good. Similarly, the next block would be:\n\n1 2 3\n4 5 6\n\nAnd so on. So, this seems to work for columns. Similarly, for rows, if I stack these blocks vertically, I need to ensure that every 3x2 block also contains 1-6. Let's see:\n\nRow 1: 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3...\nRow 2: 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6...\n\nNow, if I take a 3x2 block starting at row 1, column 1:\n\n1 2\n4 5\n1 2\n\nWait, that's not good because the number 1 appears twice in the first column. So, this approach doesn't work. Hmm.\n\nMaybe I need a different arrangement. Perhaps using a different permutation for the vertical shift. Let me try:\n\nFirst 2x3 block:\n\n1 2 3\n4 5 6\n\nNext 2x3 block shifted vertically:\n\n5 6 1\n2 3 4\n\nBut then, the overlapping 2x3 block would be:\n\n2 3 5\n3 4 6\n\nWait, that doesn't contain all numbers 1-6. So, this approach isn't working either.\n\nMaybe it's not possible to have such a grid for m=2 and n=3. So, perhaps only when m and n are both 1, or one of them is 1, or both are 2.\n\nWait, but let's think about m=2 and n=2 again. It works because the 2x2 Latin square can be tiled infinitely without causing overlaps that violate the condition. So, maybe the only possible pairs are (1, n), (n, 1), and (2,2).\n\nBut wait, what about m=2 and n=4? Let's see. A= {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}. We need every 2x4 or 4x2 rectangle to contain each number exactly once. Hmm, that seems more complex. Maybe it's possible, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the only possible pairs are when m and n are both 1, or one of them is 1, or both are 2. Because for higher m and n, the overlapping constraints become too tight.\n\nWait, another angle: the problem is similar to a \"perfect\" grid where every m×n window is a Latin rectangle. This is related to the concept of a \"window property\" in combinatorics. I think such grids are called \"window Latin squares\" or something similar. From what I recall, such grids exist only for certain m and n.\n\nIn particular, I think that for the window property to hold, the grid must be a torus, and the window size must divide the grid size. But since our grid is infinite, it's more about the periods. So, maybe m and n must be such that their greatest common divisor is 1, i.e., they are coprime. But earlier, m=2 and n=2 are not coprime, yet it's possible. So, that might not be the condition.\n\nWait, maybe the condition is that m and n are both 1, or one of them is 1, or both are 2. Because for m=2 and n=2, it's possible, but for higher m and n, it's not. Let me check m=2 and n=3 again.\n\nIf I try to construct a grid where every 2x3 block is a Latin rectangle, I run into issues with overlapping blocks causing duplicates. So, maybe it's", "answer": "y mod n = y' mod n oraz (x - y) mod m = (x' - y') mod m.\n\nTo zaś jest równoważne temu, że n dzieli liczbę y − y′ oraz m dzieli liczbę x − y − (x′ − y′) = (x − x′) − (y − y′).\n\nWykazujemy, że każdy prostokąt m × n przykrywa parami różne liczby. Należy pokazać, że jeśli |x − x′| < m, |y − y′| < n i f(x, y) = f(x′, y′), to x = x′ i y = y′. Na mocy obserwacji poczynionej powyżej, liczba y − y′ dzieli się przez n, a liczba (x − x′) − (y − y′) dzieli się przez m. Jedyną liczbą o module mniejszym od n podzielną przez n jest 0 — zatem y−y′ = 0. Wtedy (x−x′)−(y−y′) = x−x′ jest podzielną przez m liczbą o module mniejszym od m — zatem x−x′ = 0. Ostatecznie x = x′ i y = y′.\n\nTeraz wykazujemy, że każdy prostokąt n × m przykrywa parami różne liczby. Należy pokazać, że z warunków |x − x′| < n, |y − y′| < m i f(x, y) = f(x′, y′) wynika, że x = x′ i y = y′. Analogicznie jak wyżej stwierdzamy, że y−y′ dzieli się przez n oraz że (x−x′)−(y−y′) dzieli się przez m. Liczba m dzieli się przez n, więc n dzieli liczbę (x−x′)−(y−y′), a skoro n dzieli y − y′, to musi też dzielić x − x′. Ponieważ x − x′ jest podzielna przez n liczbą o module mniejszym od n, więc x − x′ = 0. Stąd wniosek, że liczba (x − x′) − (y − y′) jest równa y′ − y. Jest ona podzielna przez m i ma moduł mniejszy od m, więc y′ − y = 0. Otrzymaliśmy zatem x = x′ i y = y′."}

Hmm, interesting. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem clearly. We're looking for positive integers \\( k \\) such that there's no integer \\( n \\) and prime \\( p \\) where \\( k = n^2 + p \\). And the question is whether there are infinitely many such \\( k \\).\n\nI think a good starting point is to consider the possible forms of \\( k \\). Since \\( n^2 \\) is always non-negative, \\( k \\) must be at least as big as the smallest prime, which is 2. So, \\( k \\) can be 2 or larger. But wait, actually, \\( n \\) can be zero, right? Because zero is an integer. So, if \\( n = 0 \\), then \\( k = 0 + p = p \\). So, all prime numbers can be expressed as \\( 0^2 + p \\). That means primes are all expressible in this form. So, primes are out of the question for being in the set of numbers we're looking for.\n\nBut what about composite numbers? Let's see. For example, take \\( k = 4 \\). Can 4 be written as \\( n^2 + p \\)? Let's try \\( n = 1 \\): \\( 1 + p = 4 \\) implies \\( p = 3 \\), which is prime. So, yes, 4 can be expressed as \\( 1^2 + 3 \\). How about \\( k = 6 \\)? Let's try \\( n = 1 \\): \\( 1 + p = 6 \\) gives \\( p = 5 \\), which is prime. So, 6 is expressible. What about \\( k = 8 \\)? \\( n = 2 \\): \\( 4 + p = 8 \\) gives \\( p = 4 \\), which isn't prime. \\( n = 1 \\): \\( 1 + p = 8 \\) gives \\( p = 7 \\), which is prime. So, 8 is expressible.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for numbers that can't be expressed this way. Let's try \\( k = 1 \\). But \\( k \\) has to be positive, so 1 is allowed. Can 1 be written as \\( n^2 + p \\)? Let's see: \\( n^2 \\) is at least 0, so \\( p \\) would have to be 1, but 1 isn't prime. So, 1 can't be expressed. But 1 is just one number. The question is about infinitely many.\n\nWhat about \\( k = 2 \\)? \\( n = 0 \\): \\( 0 + p = 2 \\), so \\( p = 2 \\), which is prime. So, 2 is expressible. \\( k = 3 \\): \\( n = 0 \\): \\( p = 3 \\), which is prime. So, 3 is expressible. \\( k = 5 \\): \\( n = 0 \\): \\( p = 5 \\), prime. So, 5 is expressible.\n\nWait, so maybe the only number that can't be expressed is 1? But that's just one number. The question is about infinitely many. So, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should consider the parity of \\( k \\). Let's see: \\( n^2 \\) can be even or odd. If \\( n \\) is even, \\( n^2 \\) is even; if \\( n \\) is odd, \\( n^2 \\) is odd. Primes, except for 2, are odd. So, let's consider \\( k \\) as even or odd.\n\nCase 1: \\( k \\) is even. Then, \\( n^2 + p = k \\). If \\( p = 2 \\), then \\( n^2 = k - 2 \\). So, if \\( k - 2 \\) is a perfect square, then \\( k \\) can be expressed as \\( n^2 + 2 \\). If \\( k - 2 \\) isn't a perfect square, maybe \\( p \\) is an odd prime. Then, \\( n^2 \\) must be odd, so \\( n \\) must be odd. So, \\( n^2 \\) is odd, \\( p \\) is odd, so their sum is even. So, for even \\( k \\), it's possible to express \\( k \\) as \\( n^2 + p \\) if either \\( k - 2 \\) is a square or \\( k - \\) some odd prime is a square.\n\nCase 2: \\( k \\) is odd. Then, \\( n^2 + p = k \\). If \\( p = 2 \\), then \\( n^2 = k - 2 \\). So, if \\( k - 2 \\) is a square, then \\( k \\) can be expressed as \\( n^2 + 2 \\). If \\( k - 2 \\) isn't a square, then \\( p \\) must be an odd prime, so \\( n^2 \\) must be even, meaning \\( n \\) is even. So, \\( n^2 \\) is even, \\( p \\) is odd, sum is odd.\n\nSo, for both even and odd \\( k \\), the key seems to be whether \\( k - p \\) is a square for some prime \\( p \\).\n\nNow, the question is whether there are infinitely many \\( k \\) such that for all primes \\( p \\), \\( k - p \\) is not a perfect square.\n\nAlternatively, for each \\( k \\), we can check if there exists a prime \\( p \\) such that \\( p = k - n^2 \\) for some integer \\( n \\). If no such \\( p \\) exists, then \\( k \\) is in our set.\n\nSo, to find infinitely many \\( k \\) where \\( k - n^2 \\) is never prime for any \\( n \\).\n\nHmm. Let's think about the density of primes and squares. The number of squares grows quadratically, while primes grow roughly linearly in density. So, for large \\( k \\), the number of possible \\( n \\) such that \\( n^2 < k \\) is about \\( \\sqrt{k} \\). For each such \\( n \\), \\( k - n^2 \\) is a number that could be prime or not.\n\nBut primes become less frequent as numbers grow, but still, for each \\( k \\), there are about \\( \\sqrt{k} \\) candidates for \\( p \\). So, intuitively, it's likely that for most \\( k \\), at least one of these \\( k - n^2 \\) is prime. But the question is whether there are infinitely many \\( k \\) where none of the \\( k - n^2 \\) are prime.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can construct an infinite set of \\( k \\) such that \\( k - n^2 \\) is always composite.\n\nOne approach might be to consider \\( k \\) such that \\( k \\equiv 0 \\mod m \\) for some modulus \\( m \\), making \\( k - n^2 \\) always divisible by \\( m \\), hence composite, provided \\( k \\) is large enough.\n\nLet me think about this. Suppose we choose \\( k \\) such that \\( k \\equiv 0 \\mod 4 \\). Then, \\( k - n^2 \\) would be \\( 0 - n^2 \\mod 4 \\). But \\( n^2 \\mod 4 \\) can be 0 or 1. So, if \\( k \\equiv 0 \\mod 4 \\), then \\( k - n^2 \\equiv -n^2 \\mod 4 \\). If \\( n \\) is even, \\( n^2 \\equiv 0 \\mod 4 \\), so \\( k - n^2 \\equiv 0 \\mod 4 \\). If \\( n \\) is odd, \\( n^2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 4 \\), so \\( k - n^2 \\equiv -1 \\mod 4 \\), which is 3 mod 4. So, \\( k - n^2 \\) is either 0 mod 4 or 3 mod 4. If it's 0 mod 4, then it's divisible by 4, so unless it's 2, it's composite. If it's 3 mod 4, it could be prime or not.\n\nBut wait, if \\( k \\) is a multiple of 4, say \\( k = 4m \\), then for even \\( n \\), \\( k - n^2 = 4m - (2a)^2 = 4(m - a^2) \\), which is divisible by 4, so unless it's 2, it's composite. For odd \\( n \\), \\( k - n^2 = 4m - (2a+1)^2 = 4m - (4a^2 +4a +1) = 4(m - a^2 -a) -1 \\), which is 3 mod 4. So, \\( k - n^2 \\) is either 0 mod 4 or 3 mod 4.\n\nSo, for \\( k = 4m \\), \\( k - n^2 \\) is either divisible by 4 or 3 mod 4. If \\( k - n^2 \\) is 0 mod 4, it's composite unless it's 2, but since \\( k \\) is at least 4, \\( k - n^2 \\) would be at least 4 - 0 = 4, so it's composite. If \\( k - n^2 \\) is 3 mod 4, it could be prime or not. For example, 3 is prime, 7 is prime, 11 is prime, etc. So, just choosing \\( k \\) as multiples of 4 doesn't guarantee that all \\( k - n^2 \\) are composite, because for some \\( n \\), \\( k - n^2 \\) could be a prime that's 3 mod 4.\n\nSo, maybe this approach isn't sufficient. Let me think of another modulus.\n\nWhat if I choose \\( k \\) such that \\( k \\equiv 1 \\mod 4 \\). Then, \\( k - n^2 \\equiv 1 - n^2 \\mod 4 \\). If \\( n \\) is even, \\( n^2 \\equiv 0 \\mod 4 \\), so \\( k - n^2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 4 \\). If \\( n \\) is odd, \\( n^2 \\equiv 1 \\mod 4 \\), so \\( k - n^2 \\equiv 0 \\mod 4 \\). So, for \\( k \\equiv 1 \\mod 4 \\), \\( k - n^2 \\) is either 1 mod 4 or 0 mod 4. If it's 0 mod 4, it's composite (as before). If it's 1 mod 4, it could be prime or not. So again, not sufficient.\n\nMaybe a different modulus. Let's try modulus 3. If \\( k \\equiv 0 \\mod 3 \\), then \\( k - n^2 \\equiv -n^2 \\mod 3 \\). The squares mod 3 are 0 and 1. So, \\( k - n^2 \\equiv 0 \\) or \\( -1 \\mod 3 \\). If \\( k \\equiv 0 \\mod 3 \\), then \\( k - n^2 \\equiv 0 \\) or 2 mod 3. So, if \\( k - n^2 \\equiv 0 \\mod 3 \\), it's divisible by 3, hence composite unless it's 3. If \\( k - n^2 \\equiv 2 \\mod 3 \\), it could be prime or not.\n\nBut again, this doesn't guarantee that all \\( k - n^2 \\) are composite. For example, if \\( k = 6 \\), which is 0 mod 3, then \\( k - n^2 \\) could be 6 - 0 = 6 (composite), 6 -1=5 (prime), 6-4=2 (prime), etc. So, 6 can be expressed as \\( 1^2 +5 \\) or \\( 2^2 +2 \\).\n\nHmm, maybe I need a different approach. Perhaps instead of looking at specific moduli, I should consider the growth rates. The number of squares up to \\( k \\) is about \\( \\sqrt{k} \\), and the number of primes up to \\( k \\) is about \\( k / \\log k \\). So, for each \\( k \\), there are about \\( \\sqrt{k} \\) possible \\( p \\) to check. The probability that a random number around \\( k \\) is prime is about \\( 1 / \\log k \\). So, the expected number of primes \\( p \\) such that \\( p = k - n^2 \\) is roughly \\( \\sqrt{k} / \\log k \\). As \\( k \\) grows, this expectation increases, meaning it's more likely that such a prime exists. So, heuristically, it's likely that almost all \\( k \\) can be expressed as \\( n^2 + p \\), but the question is whether there are still infinitely many that can't.\n\nBut this is just a heuristic. I need a more concrete argument.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps consider \\( k \\) such that \\( k - n^2 \\) is always even and greater than 2, hence composite. For example, if \\( k \\) is odd, then \\( n^2 \\) must be even (since \\( p \\) would have to be odd, as \\( k \\) is odd and \\( n^2 \\) is even). So, \\( n \\) must be even. Let \\( n = 2m \\). Then, \\( k = (2m)^2 + p = 4m^2 + p \\). So, \\( p = k - 4m^2 \\). If \\( k \\) is odd, \\( p \\) must be odd, so \\( k - 4m^2 \\) must be odd. Since \\( 4m^2 \\) is even, \\( k \\) must be odd + even = odd, which it is.\n\nBut how does this help? Maybe if I can find \\( k \\) such that \\( k - 4m^2 \\) is always even and greater than 2, hence composite. Wait, \\( k - 4m^2 \\) would be odd because \\( k \\) is odd and \\( 4m^2 \\) is even. So, it can't be even. So, that approach doesn't work.\n\nWait, perhaps if I consider \\( k \\) such that \\( k \\equiv 1 \\mod 4 \\). Then, \\( k - n^2 \\) would be 1 - n^2 mod 4. If \\(", "answer": "Udowodnimy, że dla dowolnej nieparzystej liczby \\(a \\geq 3\\) liczby \\(\\left(\\frac{3a+1}{2}\\right)^2\\) nie można przedstawić w żądanej postaci.

Let me try to understand it step by step. \n\nWe have a circle with a finite number of chords marked on it. A \"cycle\" is defined as a closed polygonal chain made up of at least three distinct marked chords. Two cycles are considered the same if they consist of the same set of chords. \n\nIt's given that there's a special cycle C made up of 2022 chords. This cycle C has the property that every other cycle shares at least one chord with it. The task is to find the maximum possible number of cycles.\n\nHmm, so I need to figure out how many different cycles can exist under the condition that each one must share at least one chord with cycle C. And we want the maximum number of such cycles.\n\nLet me think about how cycles can be formed. Each cycle is a set of chords that form a closed loop. Since all cycles must share at least one chord with C, which has 2022 chords, maybe the maximum number of cycles is related to the number of subsets of C's chords?\n\nWait, but cycles are more than just any subset; they have to form a closed loop. So, not every subset of chords will form a cycle. They need to connect in a way that the endpoints are connected properly.\n\nBut maybe I can model this as a graph problem. If I consider the circle as a graph where the chords are edges, then a cycle is a cycle in the graph. So, the problem reduces to finding the maximum number of cycles in a graph where every cycle must share at least one edge with a specific cycle C of length 2022.\n\nIn graph theory, the maximum number of cycles in a graph is achieved when the graph is a complete graph, but in this case, the graph is a circle with chords, so it's a planar graph. Planar graphs have limitations on the number of edges and cycles.\n\nWait, but maybe I don't need to think about planar graphs. The problem is about cycles in terms of chord diagrams, not necessarily planar embeddings. So perhaps it's more about combinatorics.\n\nEach cycle must share at least one chord with C. So, the total number of cycles is the sum over each chord in C of the number of cycles that include that chord, minus the overlaps where cycles include multiple chords from C.\n\nBut inclusion-exclusion might get complicated here. Maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, if every cycle must include at least one chord from C, then the total number of cycles is equal to the number of cycles in the entire graph minus the number of cycles that don't include any chord from C. But since the problem states that every cycle must share at least one chord with C, the number of cycles that don't include any chord from C is zero. So, the total number of cycles is just the number of cycles in the entire graph.\n\nBut wait, no. The problem says that there exists a cycle C such that every other cycle shares at least one chord with C. So, it's not that all cycles in the graph must share a chord with C, but rather that in the entire set of cycles, each one must share at least one chord with C. So, the graph is constructed in such a way that any cycle you can form must intersect C.\n\nSo, perhaps the graph is designed so that C is a \"hitting set\" for all cycles. That is, every cycle must intersect C, meaning C is a feedback edge set.\n\nIn graph theory, a feedback edge set is a set of edges whose removal makes the graph acyclic. So, if C is a feedback edge set, then removing C would make the graph acyclic, meaning there are no cycles left. Therefore, every cycle in the original graph must include at least one edge from C.\n\nSo, in this case, C is a feedback edge set. Therefore, the number of cycles in the graph is equal to the number of cycles that include at least one edge from C.\n\nBut we need to maximize the number of cycles, given that C has 2022 edges. So, how can we arrange the graph such that C is a feedback edge set, and the number of cycles is maximized.\n\nIn other words, we need to construct a graph where C is a feedback edge set, and the number of cycles is as large as possible. The maximum number of cycles would occur when the graph is as dense as possible, but with C being a feedback edge set.\n\nWait, but in a circle with chords, the graph is a chordal graph. Each chord connects two points on the circle. So, the graph is actually a 1-planar graph, since it's drawn on a plane with chords as edges.\n\nBut maybe I can think of it as a graph where the vertices are points on the circle, and the edges are the chords. So, the graph is a circle with n vertices and m chords.\n\nGiven that, the feedback edge set C has 2022 edges. So, the number of cycles is the number of cycles in the graph, which is equal to the number of cycles that include at least one edge from C.\n\nBut since C is a feedback edge set, the graph minus C is a forest. So, the number of cycles is equal to the number of cycles in the original graph, which is the number of cycles that include at least one edge from C.\n\nTo maximize the number of cycles, we need to maximize the number of cycles that include at least one edge from C. So, perhaps the graph is constructed such that C is a spanning tree plus one edge, but that might not be the case.\n\nWait, no. If C is a feedback edge set, then the graph minus C is a forest. So, the number of edges in the graph is equal to the number of edges in the forest plus the number of edges in C.\n\nBut the number of edges in a forest with n vertices is at most n-1. So, if the graph has m edges, then m = (n - 1) + |C|, where |C| = 2022.\n\nBut we don't know n, the number of vertices. Hmm.\n\nWait, but in the problem, it's just a circle with a finite number of chords. So, the number of vertices is equal to the number of endpoints of the chords. Since each chord connects two points, the number of vertices is at least 2, but in our case, since we have 2022 chords in C, each chord connects two distinct points, so the number of vertices is at least 2022*2, but that's not necessarily the case because chords can share endpoints.\n\nWait, actually, each chord is a connection between two points on the circle. So, if we have m chords, the number of vertices is at least m + 1, but in reality, it's more complicated because chords can share endpoints.\n\nBut perhaps the number of vertices is not fixed, so to maximize the number of cycles, we need to arrange the chords such that the graph is as connected as possible, but with C being a feedback edge set.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think combinatorially.\n\nEach cycle must include at least one chord from C. So, the total number of cycles is the sum over each chord in C of the number of cycles that include that chord, minus the overlaps where cycles include multiple chords from C.\n\nBut inclusion-exclusion for 2022 chords would be too complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, if we fix C as a set of 2022 chords, then any cycle must include at least one chord from C. So, the number of cycles is equal to the number of cycles in the entire graph, which is the same as the number of cycles that include at least one chord from C.\n\nBut how do we maximize this number? We need to arrange the chords such that as many cycles as possible include at least one chord from C.\n\nWait, but if C is a feedback edge set, then the graph minus C is a forest. So, the number of cycles is equal to the number of cycles in the original graph, which is the number of cycles that include at least one edge from C.\n\nTo maximize the number of cycles, we need to maximize the number of cycles that include at least one edge from C. So, perhaps the graph is constructed such that C is a set of edges that, when removed, leaves a tree. Then, the number of cycles is equal to the number of fundamental cycles with respect to the spanning tree.\n\nBut in that case, the number of cycles would be equal to the number of edges not in the spanning tree, which is |C| = 2022. But that's only if the graph is a unicyclic graph, which has exactly one cycle. But we need more cycles.\n\nWait, no. If the graph minus C is a forest, then the number of cycles is equal to the number of edges in C times something. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, think of the graph as a 2-connected graph where C is a minimal feedback edge set. Then, the number of cycles can be large.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about it differently.\n\nSuppose we have a circle with n points, and we have 2022 chords in C. Each chord in C can be part of many cycles. To maximize the number of cycles, we need each chord in C to be part of as many cycles as possible.\n\nBut how?\n\nIf we arrange the chords such that each chord in C is part of many small cycles, then the total number of cycles would be large.\n\nWait, but each cycle must be a closed polygonal chain with at least three chords. So, each cycle is a polygon with at least three sides.\n\nIf we have a chord in C, say chord e, then the number of cycles that include e is equal to the number of ways to connect the endpoints of e with other chords to form a cycle.\n\nBut to maximize this, we need as many chords as possible connected to the endpoints of e.\n\nWait, but the problem is that all cycles must include at least one chord from C. So, if we have a chord e in C, and we connect its endpoints with many other chords, then each of those connections can form a cycle with e.\n\nBut if we have multiple chords in C, then cycles can include multiple chords from C, but each cycle only needs to include at least one.\n\nSo, to maximize the number of cycles, we can arrange the chords such that each chord in C is part of as many cycles as possible, and also, the chords not in C are arranged in such a way that they don't form any cycles on their own, because otherwise, those cycles wouldn't include any chord from C, which is not allowed.\n\nWait, but the problem says that every cycle must share at least one chord with C. So, the graph must be constructed such that there are no cycles entirely composed of chords not in C. Therefore, the subgraph induced by the chords not in C must be acyclic.\n\nSo, the subgraph without C is a forest. Therefore, the number of edges not in C is at most n - 1, where n is the number of vertices.\n\nBut we don't know n. However, each chord connects two vertices, so the number of vertices is at least the number of endpoints, but chords can share endpoints.\n\nWait, but if we have m chords, the number of vertices is at least m + 1, but in reality, it's more because each chord has two endpoints.\n\nWait, actually, the number of vertices is equal to the number of distinct endpoints of all chords. So, if we have m chords, the number of vertices is at least m + 1, but in reality, it's more because each chord has two endpoints.\n\nWait, no. For example, with one chord, you have two vertices. With two chords, if they share an endpoint, you have three vertices; if they don't, you have four. So, the number of vertices is at least m + 1, but can be more.\n\nBut in our case, we have 2022 chords in C, so the number of vertices is at least 2022 + 1 = 2023, but actually, since each chord has two endpoints, the number of vertices is at least 2022*2 / k, where k is the maximum number of chords sharing a single vertex.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think in terms of the number of cycles.\n\nIf the subgraph without C is a forest, then the number of edges not in C is at most n - 1, where n is the number of vertices. So, the total number of edges is |C| + (n - 1) = 2022 + (n - 1).\n\nBut the number of vertices n is equal to the number of distinct endpoints of all chords. Since each chord has two endpoints, and we have 2022 chords in C, the number of vertices is at least 2022*2 / k, where k is the maximum number of chords sharing a single vertex.\n\nBut to maximize the number of cycles, we need as many vertices as possible, because more vertices allow for more chords and more cycles.\n\nWait, but the number of vertices is limited by the number of chords. Each chord adds two endpoints, but they can overlap.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of vertices is 2022*2, but that would be if all chords are non-overlapping, which is not possible because chords can intersect.\n\nWait, no. On a circle, you can have multiple chords connecting the same pair of points, but in our case, chords are distinct, so each chord connects two distinct points, but different chords can share endpoints.\n\nSo, the number of vertices is at least 2022*2 / k, where k is the maximum number of chords sharing a single vertex.\n\nBut to maximize the number of vertices, we need to minimize k, which is 1, but that would require each chord to have unique endpoints, which is not possible because each chord has two endpoints, so with 2022 chords, you need at least 2022*2 / 2 = 2022 vertices, but that's only if each vertex is shared by exactly two chords.\n\nWait, no. If each vertex is shared by exactly two chords, then the number of vertices is 2022*2 / 2 = 2022. So, n = 2022.\n\nBut that would mean that the graph is a 2-regular graph, which is a collection of cycles. But in our case, the graph is a circle with chords, so it's a planar graph.\n\nWait, but if we have 2022 chords, each connecting two vertices, and each vertex is connected to exactly two chords, then the graph is a collection of cycles. But since it's on a circle, it's a single cycle of length 2022. But that's just the cycle C itself.\n\nBut we need more chords to form more cycles. So, perhaps the number of vertices is larger.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the number of cycles.\n\nIf the subgraph without C is a forest, then the number of edges not in C is at most n - 1. So, the total number of edges is 2022 + (n - 1). \n\nBut the number of vertices n is equal to the number of distinct endpoints of all chords.

Znaleźć wszystkie pary dodatnich liczb całkowitych (n, k), dla których gra w (n, k)-kamienie nigdy nie zakończy się porażką, niezależnie od tego kto turę rozegra.", "response": "Okay, so I have this problem about a game called (n, k)-stones. It's played on a rectangular board with n fields in a row. At the start, there's a stone on the k-th field from the left, and all others are empty. Each turn, you put a dot on every stone. Then, you place a stone on every field that's adjacent to exactly one field with a dotted stone. After that, you remove all the dotted stones. The game ends when there are no stones left. I need to find all pairs of positive integers (n, k) where the game never ends in a loss, regardless of how the turns are played. Hmm, interesting.\n\nFirst, let me try to understand the rules step by step. So, the board has n positions in a row. Initially, only the k-th position has a stone. Each turn, every stone gets a dot. Then, for each field, if it's adjacent to exactly one field with a dotted stone, you place a new stone there. After placing all new stones, you remove all the dotted stones. The game ends when there are no stones left. So, if the game never ends, it means that the number of stones keeps increasing or oscillating in such a way that it never dies out.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"gra nigdy nie zakończy się porażką\", which translates to \"the game never ends in a loss\". So, it's about the game not terminating, meaning it goes on forever. So, we need to find all (n, k) where the game doesn't terminate, regardless of how the players play. But wait, the problem says \"niezależnie od tego, kto turę rozegra\", which is \"regardless of who plays the turn\". Hmm, maybe it's a two-player game? Or is it a single-player game? The original problem says \"gra w (n, k)-kamienie\", so maybe it's a single-player game, and the question is about whether the game can be made to never end, regardless of the moves. Or perhaps it's about whether the game will always end, no matter how you play. Wait, the translation is a bit unclear.\n\nWait, the original problem says: \"Znaleźć wszystkie pary dodatnich liczb całkowitych (n, k), dla których gra w (n, k)-kamienie nigdy nie zakończy się porażką, niezależnie od tego kto turę rozegra.\" So, it's about finding all (n, k) such that the game never ends in a loss, regardless of who plays the turn. So, maybe it's a two-player game where each player takes turns, and regardless of how they play, the game never ends. Or perhaps it's a single-player game where regardless of the moves, the game doesn't end. Hmm, maybe it's a cellular automaton kind of game, similar to Conway's Game of Life, where the stones evolve based on certain rules.\n\nLet me think of it as a deterministic process. Each turn, the stones are dotted, then new stones are placed based on the adjacency of dotted stones, and then the dotted stones are removed. So, the state of the board evolves each turn based on the previous state. The game ends when the board is empty. So, we need to find (n, k) where this process never ends, i.e., the number of stones doesn't reach zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the game can end in a loss if the player can't make a move, but in this case, the rules specify that you always place stones based on the current configuration, so maybe the game can't end unless the board is empty. So, the game ends when the board is empty, and we need to find (n, k) where the game never becomes empty, i.e., it goes on forever.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding all (n, k) where the process starting with a single stone at position k on a board of size n never dies out.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let's denote the state of the board as a set of positions where stones are present. Each turn, we add dots to all stones, then for each position, if it's adjacent to exactly one dotted stone, we add a new stone there. Then, we remove all dotted stones.\n\nWait, so the process is similar to a cellular automaton with specific rules. Let me try to formalize it.\n\nLet S_t be the set of stones at time t. Then, at each step:\n\n1. Mark all stones in S_t with a dot.\n2. For each position i, if the number of dotted stones adjacent to i is exactly 1, then add i to S_{t+1}.\n3. Remove all dots from S_t, so S_{t+1} is the new set of stones.\n\nWait, no. Actually, step 2 is adding new stones based on the current S_t, and then step 3 is removing the old stones. So, S_{t+1} is the set of positions adjacent to exactly one stone in S_t. Because after adding the new stones, the old ones are removed.\n\nWait, no. Let me read the problem again:\n\n\"Na każdym kamieniu na planszy stawiamy kropkę. Następnie kładziemy kamień (bez kropki) na każdym polu sąsiadującym z dokładnie jednym polem, na którym znajduje się kamień z kropką. Na końcu gry zdejmujemy z planszy wszystkie kamienie z kropką.\"\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. On each stone, put a dot. So, all stones in S_t get a dot.\n2. For each field, if it is adjacent to exactly one field with a dotted stone, place a new stone (without a dot) there. So, S_{t+1} is the set of positions adjacent to exactly one position in S_t.\n3. Remove all stones with dots. So, S_{t+1} is the new set, and S_t is removed.\n\nTherefore, the next state S_{t+1} is the set of positions adjacent to exactly one position in S_t.\n\nSo, the process is: S_{t+1} = { i | number of j in S_t such that |i - j| = 1 is exactly 1 }.\n\nThis is similar to the \"next generation\" in cellular automata, where each cell is born if it has exactly one neighbor in the current generation.\n\nSo, the rule is: a cell becomes alive in the next generation if it has exactly one live neighbor in the current generation.\n\nThis is a specific rule, which is different from the standard Game of Life rules. Let me see if I can find any patterns or cycles.\n\nGiven that, let's try to simulate this process for small n and k to see what happens.\n\nCase 1: n = 1, k = 1.\n\nSo, the board has only one position. Initially, S_0 = {1}.\n\nAt t=0: S_0 = {1}\n\nt=1: Check positions adjacent to exactly one stone in S_0. Since n=1, position 1 has no neighbors. So, S_1 = empty set.\n\nThus, the game ends at t=1. So, (1,1) is a losing position.\n\nCase 2: n=2, k=1.\n\nS_0 = {1}\n\nt=1: Check neighbors of 1. Position 1 has neighbor 2. So, position 2 is adjacent to exactly one stone (position 1). So, S_1 = {2}\n\nt=2: Check neighbors of 2. Position 2 has neighbor 1. So, position 1 is adjacent to exactly one stone (position 2). So, S_2 = {1}\n\nt=3: S_3 = {2}\n\nt=4: S_4 = {1}\n\nAnd so on. So, it oscillates between {1} and {2}. Therefore, the game never ends. So, (2,1) is a non-terminating position.\n\nSimilarly, for n=2, k=2: same as k=1, because it's symmetric. So, (2,2) also never ends.\n\nCase 3: n=3, k=1.\n\nS_0 = {1}\n\nt=1: Neighbors of 1 is 2. So, S_1 = {2}\n\nt=2: Neighbors of 2 are 1 and 3. So, each of 1 and 3 is adjacent to exactly one stone (position 2). So, S_2 = {1,3}\n\nt=3: For each position in S_2, check their neighbors.\n\nPosition 1: neighbors are 2. So, position 2 is adjacent to exactly one stone (position 1). Similarly, position 3: neighbors are 2. So, position 2 is adjacent to exactly one stone (position 3). So, S_3 = {2}\n\nt=4: Neighbors of 2 are 1 and 3. So, S_4 = {1,3}\n\nt=5: S_5 = {2}\n\nAnd so on. So, it oscillates between {2} and {1,3}. Therefore, the game never ends. So, (3,1) is non-terminating.\n\nSimilarly, for n=3, k=2: S_0 = {2}\n\nt=1: Neighbors of 2 are 1 and 3. So, S_1 = {1,3}\n\nt=2: For each in S_1, neighbors are 2. So, position 2 is adjacent to two stones (1 and 3). So, since we need exactly one, position 2 is not added. So, S_2 = empty set.\n\nThus, the game ends at t=2. So, (3,2) is a losing position.\n\nSimilarly, n=3, k=3: same as k=1, symmetric. So, (3,3) is non-terminating.\n\nCase 4: n=4, k=1.\n\nS_0 = {1}\n\nt=1: Neighbors of 1 is 2. So, S_1 = {2}\n\nt=2: Neighbors of 2 are 1 and 3. So, S_2 = {1,3}\n\nt=3: For each in S_2:\n\n- Position 1: neighbor 2. So, position 2 is adjacent to exactly one stone (position 1). Similarly, position 3: neighbor 2 and 4. Position 4 is adjacent to exactly one stone (position 3). So, S_3 = {2,4}\n\nt=4: For each in S_3:\n\n- Position 2: neighbors 1 and 3. So, positions 1 and 3 are adjacent to exactly one stone (position 2). Similarly, position 4: neighbor 3. So, position 3 is adjacent to exactly one stone (position 4). So, S_4 = {1,3}\n\nt=5: For each in S_4:\n\n- Position 1: neighbor 2. So, position 2 is adjacent to exactly one stone (position 1). Position 3: neighbors 2 and 4. So, position 2 and 4 are adjacent to exactly one stone (position 3). So, S_5 = {2,4}\n\nt=6: S_6 = {1,3}\n\nAnd so on. So, it oscillates between {1,3} and {2,4}. Therefore, the game never ends. So, (4,1) is non-terminating.\n\nSimilarly, n=4, k=2:\n\nS_0 = {2}\n\nt=1: Neighbors of 2 are 1 and 3. So, S_1 = {1,3}\n\nt=2: For each in S_1:\n\n- Position 1: neighbor 2. So, position 2 is adjacent to exactly one stone (position 1). Similarly, position 3: neighbor 2 and 4. So, position 2 is adjacent to exactly one stone (position 3). So, S_2 = {2}\n\nt=3: Neighbors of 2 are 1 and 3. So, S_3 = {1,3}\n\nt=4: S_4 = {2}\n\nAnd so on. So, it oscillates between {2} and {1,3}. Therefore, the game never ends. So, (4,2) is non-terminating.\n\nSimilarly, n=4, k=3: same as k=2, symmetric. So, (4,3) is non-terminating.\n\nn=4, k=4: same as k=1, symmetric. So, (4,4) is non-terminating.\n\nCase 5: n=5, k=1.\n\nS_0 = {1}\n\nt=1: S_1 = {2}\n\nt=2: S_2 = {1,3}\n\nt=3: S_3 = {2,4}\n\nt=4: S_4 = {1,3,5}\n\nt=5: For each in S_4:\n\n- Position 1: neighbor 2. So, position 2 is adjacent to exactly one stone (position 1). Position 3: neighbors 2 and 4. So, position 2 and 4 are adjacent to exactly one stone (position 3). Position 5: neighbor 4. So, position 4 is adjacent to exactly one stone (position 5). So, S_5 = {2,4}\n\nt=6: S_6 = {1,3,5}\n\nt=7: S_7 = {2,4}\n\nAnd so on. So, it oscillates between {1,3,5} and {2,4}. Therefore, the game never ends. So, (5,1) is non-terminating.\n\nSimilarly, n=5, k=2:\n\nS_0 = {2}\n\nt=1: S_1 = {1,3}\n\nt=2: For each in S_1:\n\n- Position 1: neighbor 2. So, position 2 is adjacent to exactly one stone (position 1). Position 3: neighbors 2 and 4. So, position 2 and 4 are adjacent to exactly one stone (position 3). So, S_2 = {2,4}\n\nt=3: For each in S_2:\n\n- Position 2: neighbors 1 and 3. So, positions 1 and 3 are adjacent to exactly one stone (position 2). Position 4: neighbors 3 and 5.

Wyznaczyć wszystkie dodatnie liczby całkowite \\( n \\), dla których Jadzia może to zrobić.", "response": "Okay, so I have this problem where Jadzia has a regular tetrahedron with edge length \\( n \\). She has \\( n^2 \\) stickers, each shaped like an equilateral triangle with side length 2. She wants to cover the tetrahedron completely with these stickers, possibly folding them if needed, so that every point on the surface is covered by at least one sticker. I need to find all positive integers \\( n \\) for which this is possible.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the problem. A regular tetrahedron has four triangular faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle. The edge length of the tetrahedron is \\( n \\), so each face has a side length of \\( n \\). Each sticker is an equilateral triangle with side length 2. So, each sticker is larger than the faces of the tetrahedron if \\( n \\) is less than 2, but for \\( n \\geq 2 \\), the stickers are at least as big as the faces.\n\nWait, actually, no. The tetrahedron's faces have side length \\( n \\), and the stickers have side length 2. So, if \\( n \\) is 1, the tetrahedron's faces are smaller than the stickers. If \\( n \\) is 2, the faces are the same size as the stickers. For \\( n > 2 \\), the faces are larger than the stickers.\n\nSo, the first thought is about the area. Maybe I should calculate the total surface area of the tetrahedron and see how many stickers are needed to cover it. Then, compare that to the number of stickers Jadzia has, which is \\( n^2 \\).\n\nThe surface area of a regular tetrahedron is 4 times the area of one face. The area of an equilateral triangle with side length \\( a \\) is \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}a^2 \\). So, the total surface area \\( A \\) is:\n\n\\( A = 4 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}n^2 = \\sqrt{3}n^2 \\).\n\nEach sticker has an area of \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times 2^2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times 4 = \\sqrt{3} \\).\n\nSo, the total area of all stickers is \\( n^2 \\times \\sqrt{3} \\).\n\nComparing this to the surface area of the tetrahedron, which is \\( \\sqrt{3}n^2 \\), it seems that the total area of the stickers is exactly equal to the surface area of the tetrahedron. So, in terms of area, it's just enough. But area alone doesn't guarantee that the stickers can cover the tetrahedron without gaps or overlaps, especially considering the shape and how they can be arranged.\n\nBut wait, the problem says Jadzia can fold the stickers if needed. So, maybe she can overlap them or arrange them in a way that covers the entire surface. However, folding might complicate things because each sticker is a flat triangle, and folding it would mean that parts of it can cover different faces of the tetrahedron.\n\nBut let me think about the tiling. Each face of the tetrahedron is an equilateral triangle of side length \\( n \\). Each sticker is an equilateral triangle of side length 2. So, if \\( n \\) is a multiple of 2, say \\( n = 2k \\), then each face can be perfectly divided into \\( k^2 \\) smaller triangles of side length 2. So, each face would require \\( k^2 \\) stickers, and since there are 4 faces, the total number of stickers needed would be \\( 4k^2 \\). But Jadzia only has \\( n^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 \\) stickers. So, in this case, it's exactly enough.\n\nWait, so if \\( n \\) is even, say \\( n = 2k \\), then each face can be tiled with \\( k^2 \\) stickers, and the total number of stickers is \\( 4k^2 = n^2 \\). So, that works.\n\nBut what if \\( n \\) is odd? Let's say \\( n = 2k + 1 \\). Then, each face is an equilateral triangle of side length \\( 2k + 1 \\). If we try to tile it with stickers of side length 2, we can't perfectly fit them because \\( 2k + 1 \\) isn't a multiple of 2. So, we might have some leftover space or need to overlap stickers.\n\nBut the problem allows folding, so maybe we can fold the stickers to cover the edges or wrap around the tetrahedron. However, folding a sticker would mean that part of it covers one face and part covers another. But each sticker is a single triangle, so folding it would make it cover two faces, but each face would only get a part of the sticker.\n\nWait, but each sticker is a single triangle. If you fold it, you can place it across an edge, covering parts of two adjacent faces. But each face is a triangle, so each edge is shared by two faces. So, maybe by folding, you can cover multiple faces with a single sticker.\n\nBut let's think about the number of stickers. If \\( n \\) is odd, say \\( n = 3 \\), then the total surface area is \\( \\sqrt{3} \\times 9 = 9\\sqrt{3} \\). Each sticker is \\( \\sqrt{3} \\), so we need 9 stickers. But Jadzia has \\( n^2 = 9 \\) stickers. So, in terms of area, it's exactly enough. But can we arrange 9 stickers, each of size 2, to cover a tetrahedron of edge length 3?\n\nWait, each face of the tetrahedron is a triangle of side length 3. If we try to cover it with stickers of side length 2, we can't fit them perfectly. Each face would need to be covered with some combination of stickers, possibly overlapping or folding.\n\nBut let's think about how many stickers can cover a single face. A face of side length 3 can be divided into smaller triangles. If we use stickers of side length 2, how many can fit?\n\nActually, an equilateral triangle of side length 3 can be divided into smaller equilateral triangles of side length 1, which would be 9 small triangles. But our stickers are of side length 2, which is larger than 1. So, each sticker would cover multiple small triangles.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of tiling. If the side length of the tetrahedron is 3, each face is a triangle with side 3. Each sticker is a triangle with side 2. So, how many stickers can fit on a face?\n\nIf we place a sticker on a face, it can cover a part of the face. But since the sticker is larger than the face's side length divided by 2, maybe we can fit one sticker per face, but that would only cover part of the face.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can arrange the stickers such that each sticker covers parts of multiple faces by folding.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the number of stickers required per face.\n\nIf \\( n \\) is even, say \\( n = 2k \\), then each face can be perfectly divided into \\( k^2 \\) stickers of side length 2, as I thought earlier. So, each face needs \\( k^2 \\) stickers, and with 4 faces, total stickers needed are \\( 4k^2 = (2k)^2 = n^2 \\). So, that works.\n\nBut for odd \\( n \\), say \\( n = 2k + 1 \\), each face is a triangle of side length \\( 2k + 1 \\). The area of each face is \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}(2k + 1)^2 \\). The area of each sticker is \\( \\sqrt{3} \\). So, the number of stickers needed per face is \\( \\frac{(2k + 1)^2}{4} \\). But since we can't have a fraction of a sticker, we need to round up. So, each face would need \\( \\lceil \\frac{(2k + 1)^2}{4} \\rceil \\) stickers.\n\nBut wait, the total number of stickers Jadzia has is \\( n^2 = (2k + 1)^2 \\). So, if each face needs \\( \\lceil \\frac{(2k + 1)^2}{4} \\rceil \\) stickers, then the total number of stickers needed is \\( 4 \\times \\lceil \\frac{(2k + 1)^2}{4} \\rceil \\). Let's compute this.\n\nFor \\( n = 3 \\), \\( k = 1 \\). So, each face needs \\( \\lceil \\frac{9}{4} \\rceil = 3 \\) stickers. So, total stickers needed would be \\( 4 \\times 3 = 12 \\). But Jadzia only has \\( 9 \\) stickers. So, that's not enough.\n\nWait, but maybe by folding, we can cover multiple faces with a single sticker, thus reducing the total number needed. For example, if a sticker is folded along an edge, it can cover parts of two faces. So, maybe we can use fewer stickers by overlapping them across edges.\n\nBut how much can we save? Each sticker can cover two faces, but each face still needs to be covered. So, maybe the number of stickers needed is less than the sum of stickers needed per face.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to calculate this exactly. Maybe I should think about the problem differently.\n\nAnother approach: Since the stickers can be folded, maybe we can arrange them such that each sticker covers multiple faces. For example, a single sticker can be folded along an edge to cover two adjacent faces. But each sticker is a triangle, so when folded, it can cover two adjacent faces, each with a smaller triangle.\n\nBut each face is a triangle of side length \\( n \\). If we fold a sticker of side length 2 along an edge, the part on each face would be a smaller triangle. The maximum coverage on each face would be a triangle of side length 2, but since the edge is shared, maybe the coverage is a smaller area.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think about the number of stickers required to cover all edges and vertices. Each edge is shared by two faces, and each vertex is shared by three faces.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for a pattern or see if there's a known tiling for tetrahedrons with smaller triangles.\n\nWait, another thought: The problem allows folding, so maybe the stickers can be arranged in such a way that they wrap around the tetrahedron, covering multiple faces. But each sticker is a single triangle, so when folded, it can cover two faces, but each face would only get a part of the sticker.\n\nBut let's think about the number of stickers. If \\( n \\) is even, as I thought before, it's straightforward because each face can be perfectly tiled with \\( (n/2)^2 \\) stickers, and the total is \\( n^2 \\). So, that works.\n\nFor \\( n \\) odd, say \\( n = 3 \\), the total number of stickers is 9. Each face has an area of \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\times 9 = \\frac{9\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\). Each sticker has an area of \\( \\sqrt{3} \\). So, each face would need \\( \\frac{9\\sqrt{3}/4}{\\sqrt{3}} = 9/4 = 2.25 \\) stickers. Since we can't have a fraction, we need at least 3 stickers per face, totaling 12 stickers. But Jadzia only has 9. So, unless we can cover multiple faces with a single sticker, it's not possible.\n\nBut if we can fold stickers to cover two faces at once, maybe we can reduce the total number needed. For example, each sticker can cover two faces, so the number of stickers needed would be half the number needed if we couldn't fold. But 12 / 2 = 6, which is less than 9, so maybe it's possible.\n\nWait, but each sticker can only cover two faces, but each face is adjacent to three others. So, maybe we can arrange the stickers such that each sticker covers two faces, and each face is covered by multiple stickers.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to calculate the exact number. Maybe I should think about the problem in terms of graph theory or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key is that when \\( n \\) is even, the tiling is straightforward, and when \\( n \\) is odd, it's not possible because the number of stickers required exceeds the available number when considering the need to cover each face adequately.\n\nWait, but for \\( n = 3 \\), the total area is 9√3, and the stickers provide exactly 9√3. So, in terms of area, it's possible. But the problem is the arrangement. Maybe it's possible to arrange the stickers in such a way that they overlap or fold to cover the entire surface.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for a pattern or see if there's a mathematical way to determine this.\n\nWait, another thought: The tetrahedron has 4 faces, each of which is a triangle. Each sticker is a triangle of side length 2. If \\( n \\) is a multiple of 2, then each face can be perfectly divided into smaller triangles of side length 2, so the tiling is straightforward. If \\( n \\) is not a multiple of 2, then each face can't be perfectly divided, but maybe by folding, we can cover the faces with overlapping stickers.\n\nBut the problem is that each sticker is a single triangle, so when folded, it can only cover two faces at a time. So, maybe the number of stickers needed is less than the sum of stickers needed per face.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to calculate this exactly. Maybe I should consider specific cases.\n\nLet's try \\( n = 1 \\). The tetrahedron has faces of side length 1. Each sticker is side length 2, which is larger. So, each sticker can cover multiple faces by folding. But the total area is \\( \\sqrt{3} \\times 1^2 = \\sqrt{3} \\), and each sticker is \\( \\sqrt{3} \\), so Jadzia has 1 sticker. So, can one sticker cover the entire tetrahedron? Well, a single sticker is a triangle of side length 2, which is larger than the tetrahedron's faces. If she folds it, maybe she can cover all four faces? But I'm not sure. It seems unlikely because the sticker is a flat triangle, and the tetrahedron is a 3D object. So, maybe it's not possible to cover all four faces with a single sticker, even if folded. So, \\( n = 1 \\) might not work.\n\nWait, but the problem says", "answer": "Jadzia może okleić kostkę zgodnie z warunkami zadania dla wszystkich dodatnich liczb całkowitych \\( n \\).  \n\nW rozwiązaniu wykorzystamy następujące obserwacje: jeśli \\( m \\) jest liczbą naturalną i \\( a > 0 \\), to trójkąt równoboczny o boku \\( m \\cdot a \\) można podzielić na \\( m^2 \\) trójkątów równobocznych o boku \\( a \\).

Hmm, quadratic function, so it should have the form \\( f(t) = at^2 + bt + c \\) where \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are constants. Since it's quadratic, it's determined by three points, which in this case are given by \\( f(x) \\), \\( f(y) \\), and \\( f(z) \\).

Then, substituting into \\( f(t) \\), that's correct.\n\nThen, computing \\( f(x + y + z) \\):\n\n\\( f(x + y + z) = (x + y + z)^2 - (x + y + z)(x + y + z) + (xy + yz + xz) \\)\n\nYes, that's correct. The first two terms are the same, so they subtract to zero, leaving \\( xy + yz + xz \\). So, the result is \\( xy + yz + xz \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. Since \\( f(t) = t^2 - (x + y + z)t + (xy + yz + xz) \\), this can be written as:\n\n\\( f(t) = (t - x)(t - y) + (xy + yz + xz) - xy \\) ?\n\nWait, no, let me factor it differently. Alternatively, \\( f(t) = t^2 - (x + y + z)t + (xy + yz + xz) \\). Hmm, that's a quadratic in \\( t \\). Maybe I can factor it as \\( (t - x)(t - y) + z(t - x - y) \\) or something, but perhaps that's complicating.\n\nAlternatively, since \\( f(t) = t^2 - (x + y + z)t + (xy + yz + xz) \\), then \\( f(x + y + z) = (x + y + z)^2 - (x + y + z)^2 + (xy + yz + xz) = 0 + (xy + yz + xz) \\). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( f(x + y + z) \\) is \\( xy + yz + xz \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( f(x + y + z) \\) is \\boxed{xy + yz + zx}.\n</think>\n\nGiven a quadratic function \\( f \\) and three distinct real numbers \\( x, y, z \\) such that:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = yz, \\quad f(y) = zx, \\quad f(z) = xy,\n\\]\n\nwe need to find an explicit expression for \\( f(x + y + z) \\) in terms of \\( x, y, z \\).\n\nThe quadratic function \\( f \\) can be written as \\( f(t) = at^2 + bt + c \\). Using the given conditions, we set up the following system of equations:\n\n1. \\( a x^2 + b x + c = yz \\)\n2. \\( a y^2 + b y + c = zx \\)\n3. \\( a z^2 + b z + c = xy \\)\n\nSubtracting these equations pairwise to eliminate \\( c \\):\n\n- Subtracting Equation (1) from Equation (2):\n  \\[\n  a(y^2 - x^2) + b(y - x) = zx - yz \\implies (y - x)(a(y + x) + b) = -z(y - x) \\implies a(y + x) + b = -z\n  \\]\n\n- Subtracting Equation (2) from Equation (3):\n  \\[\n  a(z^2 - y^2) + b(z - y) = xy - zx \\implies (z - y)(a(z + y) + b) = -x(z - y) \\implies a(z + y) + b = -x\n  \\]\n\nSubtracting these results:\n\\[\na(z - x) = z - x \\implies a = 1\n\\]\n\nUsing \\( a = 1 \\) in the previous results:\n\\[\nx + y + b = -z \\implies b = -(x + y + z)\n\\]\n\nUsing Equation (1) to find \\( c \\):\n\\[\nx^2 - (x + y + z)x + c = yz \\implies -xy - xz + c = yz \\implies c = xy + yz + xz\n\\]\n\nThus, the quadratic function is:\n\\[\nf(t) = t^2 - (x + y + z)t + (xy + yz + xz)\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( t = x + y + z \\):\n\\[\nf(x + y + z) = (x + y + z)^2 - (x + y + z)(x + y + z) + (xy + yz + xz) = xy + yz + xz\n\\]\n\nThe value of \\( f(x + y + z) \\) is \\boxed{xy + yz + zx}.", "answer": "Funkcja \\( f \\) jest dana wzorem \\( f(t) = at^2 + bt + c \\) dla pewnych liczb rzeczywistych \\( a, b, c \\).

That should be solvable, but it's a bit complex. Let me see how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I notice that all the equations are symmetric in a way. Maybe I can find some symmetry or substitution that simplifies things. Let me think about the variables. Maybe I can pair them somehow.\n\nLet me denote \\( S = a + b + c + d = 6 \\). That's given. Maybe I can also consider other symmetric sums. Let me recall that for four variables, the elementary symmetric sums are:\n\n- \\( S_1 = a + b + c + d \\)\n- \\( S_2 = ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd \\)\n- \\( S_3 = abc + abd + acd + bcd \\)\n- \\( S_4 = abcd \\)\n\nBut in our case, the given equations are not exactly these symmetric sums. Let me see:\n\nThe first equation is \\( ab + cd = 6 \\).\n\nThe second is \\( ac + bd = 3 \\).\n\nThe third is \\( ad + bc = 2 \\).\n\nSo, if I add all three equations together, I get:\n\n\\( ab + cd + ac + bd + ad + bc = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11 \\).\n\nBut wait, \\( ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd = S_2 \\), which is the second elementary symmetric sum. So, \\( S_2 = 11 \\).\n\nWe also know \\( S_1 = 6 \\). So, we have \\( S_1 = 6 \\) and \\( S_2 = 11 \\).\n\nHmm, maybe I can find \\( S_3 \\) and \\( S_4 \\) somehow? But I don't have equations involving three variables multiplied together or all four. Maybe I need another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider variables in pairs. Let me think about grouping \\( a \\) and \\( c \\), and \\( b \\) and \\( d \\). Or maybe \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), \\( c \\) and \\( d \\). Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote \\( x = a + b \\) and \\( y = c + d \\). Then, from the fourth equation, \\( x + y = 6 \\).\n\nAlso, let's compute \\( ab + cd \\). From the first equation, \\( ab + cd = 6 \\).\n\nBut \\( ab = (a + b)^2 - (a^2 + b^2)/2 \\). Wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe I can express \\( ab \\) and \\( cd \\) in terms of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\nWait, actually, let's think about \\( (a + b)(c + d) = ac + ad + bc + bd \\). From the second and third equations, \\( ac + bd = 3 \\) and \\( ad + bc = 2 \\). So, \\( (a + b)(c + d) = 3 + 2 = 5 \\).\n\nBut \\( (a + b)(c + d) = x \\cdot y = 5 \\). So, we have:\n\n\\( x + y = 6 \\)\n\n\\( x \\cdot y = 5 \\)\n\nSo, this is a system of equations in \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). Let me solve for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\nFrom \\( x + y = 6 \\) and \\( x \\cdot y = 5 \\), we can write the quadratic equation:\n\n\\( t^2 - 6t + 5 = 0 \\)\n\nSolving this, discriminant is \\( 36 - 20 = 16 \\), so roots are \\( t = (6 \\pm 4)/2 \\), which gives \\( t = 5 \\) or \\( t = 1 \\).\n\nSo, either \\( x = 5 \\) and \\( y = 1 \\), or \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( y = 5 \\).\n\nSo, two cases:\n\nCase 1: \\( a + b = 5 \\), \\( c + d = 1 \\)\n\nCase 2: \\( a + b = 1 \\), \\( c + d = 5 \\)\n\nLet me handle each case separately.\n\n**Case 1: \\( a + b = 5 \\), \\( c + d = 1 \\)**\n\nWe also have the first equation: \\( ab + cd = 6 \\).\n\nLet me denote \\( ab = m \\) and \\( cd = n \\). Then, \\( m + n = 6 \\).\n\nAlso, from \\( a + b = 5 \\), we can write \\( ab = m \\), so the quadratic equation for \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) is \\( t^2 - 5t + m = 0 \\).\n\nSimilarly, for \\( c + d = 1 \\), \\( cd = n \\), so quadratic equation is \\( t^2 - t + n = 0 \\).\n\nAdditionally, from the second equation: \\( ac + bd = 3 \\).\n\nAnd the third equation: \\( ad + bc = 2 \\).\n\nHmm, this seems a bit involved. Maybe I can express \\( ac + bd \\) and \\( ad + bc \\) in terms of \\( a, b, c, d \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express \\( ac + bd \\) and \\( ad + bc \\) in terms of \\( a + b \\), \\( c + d \\), and other terms.\n\nWait, let me think about \\( ac + bd \\). Let me write it as \\( a c + b d \\). Since \\( a + b = 5 \\) and \\( c + d = 1 \\), maybe I can express \\( a = 5 - b \\) and \\( c = 1 - d \\). Let me try substituting.\n\nSo, \\( a = 5 - b \\), \\( c = 1 - d \\).\n\nThen, \\( ac + bd = (5 - b)(1 - d) + b d = 5(1 - d) - b(1 - d) + b d \\).\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( 5 - 5d - b + b d + b d = 5 - 5d - b + 2b d \\).\n\nBut this is equal to 3, from the second equation.\n\nSo, \\( 5 - 5d - b + 2b d = 3 \\).\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( -5d - b + 2b d = -2 \\).\n\nHmm, that's one equation.\n\nSimilarly, let's compute \\( ad + bc \\).\n\n\\( ad + bc = a d + b c = (5 - b) d + b (1 - d) = 5d - b d + b - b d = 5d + b - 2b d \\).\n\nThis is equal to 2, from the third equation.\n\nSo, \\( 5d + b - 2b d = 2 \\).\n\nSo now, we have two equations:\n\n1. \\( -5d - b + 2b d = -2 \\)\n2. \\( 5d + b - 2b d = 2 \\)\n\nLet me write them as:\n\n1. \\( -5d - b + 2b d = -2 \\) --> Equation (1)\n2. \\( 5d + b - 2b d = 2 \\) --> Equation (2)\n\nIf I add Equation (1) and Equation (2):\n\n\\( (-5d - b + 2b d) + (5d + b - 2b d) = -2 + 2 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n0 = 0\n\nHmm, that's not helpful. It means the two equations are dependent. So, I need another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let me subtract Equation (1) from Equation (2):\n\n\\( (5d + b - 2b d) - (-5d - b + 2b d) = 2 - (-2) \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( 5d + b - 2b d + 5d + b - 2b d = 4 \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\( 10d + 2b - 4b d = 4 \\)\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\( 5d + b - 2b d = 2 \\)\n\nWait, that's the same as Equation (2). So, again, not helpful.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to express one variable in terms of another.\n\nFrom Equation (2): \\( 5d + b - 2b d = 2 \\)\n\nLet me solve for b:\n\n\\( b(1 - 2d) = 2 - 5d \\)\n\nSo, \\( b = \\frac{2 - 5d}{1 - 2d} \\), provided that \\( 1 - 2d \\neq 0 \\), so \\( d \\neq 1/2 \\).\n\nSimilarly, from Equation (1): \\( -5d - b + 2b d = -2 \\)\n\nSubstitute \\( b = \\frac{2 - 5d}{1 - 2d} \\) into Equation (1):\n\n\\( -5d - \\frac{2 - 5d}{1 - 2d} + 2 \\cdot \\frac{2 - 5d}{1 - 2d} \\cdot d = -2 \\)\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: \\( -5d \\)\n\nSecond term: \\( - \\frac{2 - 5d}{1 - 2d} \\)\n\nThird term: \\( 2d \\cdot \\frac{2 - 5d}{1 - 2d} \\)\n\nSo, combining:\n\n\\( -5d - \\frac{2 - 5d}{1 - 2d} + \\frac{2d(2 - 5d)}{1 - 2d} = -2 \\)\n\nLet me combine the second and third terms:\n\n\\( - \\frac{2 - 5d}{1 - 2d} + \\frac{4d - 10d^2}{1 - 2d} = \\frac{ - (2 - 5d) + 4d - 10d^2 }{1 - 2d} \\)\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n\\( -2 + 5d + 4d - 10d^2 = -2 + 9d - 10d^2 \\)\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\( -5d + \\frac{ -2 + 9d - 10d^2 }{1 - 2d} = -2 \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by \\( 1 - 2d \\) to eliminate the denominator:\n\n\\( -5d(1 - 2d) + (-2 + 9d - 10d^2) = -2(1 - 2d) \\)\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: \\( -5d + 10d^2 \\)\n\nSecond term: \\( -2 + 9d - 10d^2 \\)\n\nRight side: \\( -2 + 4d \\)\n\nCombine left side:\n\n\\( (-5d + 10d^2) + (-2 + 9d - 10d^2) = (-5d + 9d) + (10d^2 - 10d^2) + (-2) = 4d - 2 \\)\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n\\( 4d - 2 = -2 + 4d \\)\n\nSubtract \\( 4d \\) from both sides:\n\n\\( -2 = -2 \\)\n\nHmm, that's an identity. So, again, it doesn't give us new information. That suggests that our substitution didn't help us find a unique solution, but rather that the equations are dependent.\n\nSo, perhaps I need another approach. Let me think.\n\nWe have \\( a + b = 5 \\), \\( c + d = 1 \\), \\( ab + cd = 6 \\), \\( ac + bd = 3 \\), \\( ad + bc = 2 \\).\n\nLet me consider \\( ab = m \\), \\( cd = n \\), so \\( m + n = 6 \\).\n\nAlso, from \\( a + b = 5 \\), \\( ab = m \\), so \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are roots of \\( t^2 - 5t + m = 0 \\).\n\nSimilarly, \\( c + d = 1 \\), \\( cd = n \\), so \\( c \\) and \\( d \\) are roots of \\( t^2 - t + n = 0 \\).\n\nNow, let's compute \\( ac + bd \\) and \\( ad + bc \\).\n\nNote that \\( ac + bd = 3 \\) and \\( ad + bc = 2 \\).\n\nLet me express \\( ac + bd \\) and \\( ad + bc \\) in terms of \\( a, b, c, d \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express \\( ac + bd \\) as \\( a c + b d \\). Since \\( a + b = 5 \\) and \\( c + d = 1 \\), maybe I can write \\( a = 5 - b \\) and \\( c = 1 - d \\), as before.\n\nWait, I tried that earlier, but it didn't lead anywhere. Maybe I can use another identity.\n\nLet me recall that \\( (a + c)(b + d) = ab + ad + bc + cd \\). From the given equations, \\( ab + cd = 6 \\), \\( ad + bc = 2 \\). So, \\( (a + c)(b + d) = 6 + 2 = 8 \\).\n\nSimilarly, \\( (a + d)(b + c) = ab + ac + bd + cd = 6 + 3 = 9 \\).\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, \\( (a + c)(b + d) = 8 \\) and \\( (a + d)(b + c) = 9 \\).\n\nLet me denote \\( p = a + c \\), \\( q = b + d \\), \\( r = a + d \\), \\( s = b + c \\).\n\nThen, \\( p \\cdot q = 8 \\) and \\( r \\cdot s = 9 \\).\n\nBut also, \\( p + q = a + c + b + d = 6 \\), and \\( r + s = a + d + b + c = 6 \\).\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\\( p + q = 6 \\), \\( p q = 8 \\)\n\nand\n\n\\( r + s = 6 \\), \\( r s = 9 \\)\n\nSo, let's solve for \\( p \\) and \\( q \\):\n\nFrom \\( p + q = 6 \\) and \\( p q = 8 \\), the quadratic is \\( t^2 - 6t + 8 = 0 \\), which factors as \\( (t - 2)(t - 4) = 0 \\).

So either \\( b = 0 \\) or \\( c = 0 \\).\n\nCase 1: \\( a = 0 \\), \\( b = 0 \\). Then from the second equation:\n\n\\( 0 + c^2 \\cdot 0 = 0 \\cdot 0 \\)\nWhich is \\( 0 = 0 \\). From the third equation:\n\n\\( c^3 + 0 = 0 \\cdot c \\)\nSo, \\( c^3 = 0 \\) which implies \\( c = 0 \\). So, \\( a = b = c = 0 \\) is another solution.\n\nCase 2: \\( a = 0 \\), \\( c = 0 \\). Then from the second equation:\n\n\\( b^3 + 0 = 0 \\cdot b \\)\nSo, \\( b^3 = 0 \\) which implies \\( b = 0 \\). So again, \\( a = b = c = 0 \\).\n\nSo, when \\( a = 0 \\), we get the trivial solution where all are zero.\n\nSimilarly, if I assume \\( b = 0 \\) or \\( c = 0 \\), I might get similar results. Let me check \\( b = 0 \\).\n\nIf \\( b = 0 \\), from the second equation:\n\n\\( 0 + c^2a = 0 \\cdot a \\)\nSo, \\( c^2a = 0 \\). Thus, either \\( c = 0 \\) or \\( a = 0 \\).\n\nIf \\( c = 0 \\), then from the third equation:\n\n\\( 0 + a^2 \\cdot 0 = 0 \\cdot 0 \\)\nWhich is \\( 0 = 0 \\). From the first equation:\n\n\\( a^3 + 0 = a \\cdot 0 \\)\nSo, \\( a^3 = 0 \\) which implies \\( a = 0 \\). So again, \\( a = b = c = 0 \\).\n\nIf \\( a = 0 \\), we already saw that leads to all zeros.\n\nSimilarly, if \\( c = 0 \\), from the third equation:\n\n\\( 0 + a^2b = 0 \\cdot b \\)\nSo, \\( a^2b = 0 \\). Thus, \\( a = 0 \\) or \\( b = 0 \\). Either way, we end up with all zeros.\n\nSo, the only solutions when any variable is zero are all zeros.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where none of a, b, c are zero. So, \\( a \\neq 0 \\), \\( b \\neq 0 \\), \\( c \\neq 0 \\).\n\nIn this case, I can manipulate the equations by dividing both sides by the variables.\n\nStarting with the first equation:\n\n\\( a^3 + b^2c = ac \\)\nDivide both sides by a (since \\( a \\neq 0 \\)):\n\\( a^2 + \\frac{b^2c}{a} = c \\)\nSimilarly, from the second equation:\n\n\\( b^3 + c^2a = ba \\)\nDivide both sides by b:\n\\( b^2 + \\frac{c^2a}{b} = a \\)\nAnd the third equation:\n\n\\( c^3 + a^2b = cb \\)\nDivide both sides by c:\n\\( c^2 + \\frac{a^2b}{c} = b \\)\n\nHmm, so now we have:\n\n1. \\( a^2 + \\frac{b^2c}{a} = c \\)\n2. \\( b^2 + \\frac{c^2a}{b} = a \\)\n3. \\( c^2 + \\frac{a^2b}{c} = b \\)\n\nThis seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can express each equation in terms of ratios.\n\nLet me denote \\( x = \\frac{b}{a} \\), \\( y = \\frac{c}{b} \\), \\( z = \\frac{a}{c} \\). Then, \\( xyz = 1 \\).\n\nBut I'm not sure if this substitution will help. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to express each equation as:\n\nFrom equation 1: \\( a^3 = ac - b^2c = c(a - b^2) \\)\nSimilarly, equation 2: \\( b^3 = ba - c^2a = a(b - c^2) \\)\nEquation 3: \\( c^3 = cb - a^2b = b(c - a^2) \\)\n\nSo, we have:\n\n1. \\( a^3 = c(a - b^2) \\)\n2. \\( b^3 = a(b - c^2) \\)\n3. \\( c^3 = b(c - a^2) \\)\n\nHmm, maybe I can express each variable in terms of the next.\n\nFrom equation 1: \\( c = \\frac{a^3}{a - b^2} \\) (assuming \\( a \\neq b^2 \\))\nFrom equation 2: \\( a = \\frac{b^3}{b - c^2} \\) (assuming \\( b \\neq c^2 \\))\nFrom equation 3: \\( b = \\frac{c^3}{c - a^2} \\) (assuming \\( c \\neq a^2 \\))\n\nThis seems recursive. Maybe I can substitute one into another.\n\nLet me substitute c from equation 1 into equation 2.\n\nFrom equation 1: \\( c = \\frac{a^3}{a - b^2} \\)\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\n\\( a = \\frac{b^3}{b - \\left( \\frac{a^3}{a - b^2} \\right)^2 } \\)\n\nThis looks messy, but let's try to compute the denominator:\n\nDenominator: \\( b - \\left( \\frac{a^3}{a - b^2} \\right)^2 = b - \\frac{a^6}{(a - b^2)^2} \\)\n\nSo, equation 2 becomes:\n\n\\( a = \\frac{b^3}{b - \\frac{a^6}{(a - b^2)^2}} \\)\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the ratios of the equations.\n\nFrom equation 1: \\( a^3 = c(a - b^2) \\)\nFrom equation 2: \\( b^3 = a(b - c^2) \\)\nFrom equation 3: \\( c^3 = b(c - a^2) \\)\n\nLet me take the ratio of equation 1 to equation 2:\n\n\\( \\frac{a^3}{b^3} = \\frac{c(a - b^2)}{a(b - c^2)} \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( \\left( \\frac{a}{b} \\right)^3 = \\frac{c(a - b^2)}{a(b - c^2)} \\)\n\nLet me denote \\( k = \\frac{a}{b} \\), so \\( a = k b \\). Similarly, let me denote \\( m = \\frac{b}{c} \\), so \\( b = m c \\). Then, \\( a = k m c \\).\n\nSo, substituting into the ratio:\n\n\\( k^3 = \\frac{c(k m c - b^2)}{k m c (b - c^2)} \\)\n\nWait, this might not be the best way. Maybe I should express everything in terms of one variable.\n\nAlternatively, let's assume that \\( a = b = c \\). We already saw that \\( a = b = c = \\frac{1}{2} \\) is a solution. But are there other solutions where \\( a \\), \\( b \\), \\( c \\) are not equal?\n\nSuppose \\( a = b \\neq c \\). Let me see if that's possible.\n\nIf \\( a = b \\), then from equation 1:\n\n\\( a^3 + a^2 c = a c \\)\nSimplify:\n\\( a^3 + a^2 c - a c = 0 \\)\nFactor:\n\\( a(a^2 + a c - c) = 0 \\)\nSince \\( a \\neq 0 \\), we have:\n\\( a^2 + a c - c = 0 \\)\nSimilarly, from equation 2:\n\n\\( a^3 + c^2 a = a^2 \\)\nSimplify:\n\\( a^3 + c^2 a - a^2 = 0 \\)\nFactor:\n\\( a(a^2 + c^2 - a) = 0 \\)\nAgain, \\( a \\neq 0 \\), so:\n\\( a^2 + c^2 - a = 0 \\)\n\nSo now, from equation 1: \\( a^2 + a c - c = 0 \\)\nFrom equation 2: \\( a^2 + c^2 - a = 0 \\)\n\nLet me write these as:\n\n1. \\( a^2 + a c - c = 0 \\)\n2. \\( a^2 + c^2 - a = 0 \\)\n\nLet me subtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n\\( (a^2 + c^2 - a) - (a^2 + a c - c) = 0 \\)\nSimplify:\n\\( c^2 - a - a c + c = 0 \\)\nFactor:\n\\( c^2 - a c + c - a = 0 \\)\nFactor by grouping:\n\\( c(c - a) + 1(c - a) = 0 \\)\nSo, \\( (c - a)(c + 1) = 0 \\)\n\nThus, either \\( c = a \\) or \\( c = -1 \\).\n\nCase 1: \\( c = a \\). Then, since \\( a = b = c \\), we are back to the earlier case where all are equal, which gives \\( a = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nCase 2: \\( c = -1 \\). Then, from equation 1:\n\n\\( a^2 + a(-1) - (-1) = 0 \\)\nSimplify:\n\\( a^2 - a + 1 = 0 \\)\nDiscriminant: \\( (-1)^2 - 4(1)(1) = 1 - 4 = -3 < 0 \\)\nSo, no real solutions here.\n\nThus, the only solution when \\( a = b \\) is \\( a = b = c = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nSimilarly, I can check if \\( b = c \\) or \\( a = c \\), but due to the symmetry, I think it will lead to the same conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the possibility that two variables are zero. For example, suppose \\( a = 0 \\) and \\( b = 0 \\). Then, from the third equation:\n\n\\( c^3 + 0 = 0 \\)\nSo, \\( c = 0 \\). So, again, all zeros.\n\nSimilarly, if two variables are zero, the third must be zero.\n\nSo, so far, we have two solutions: all zeros and all equal to \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nBut wait, are there other solutions where variables are not equal and not zero?\n\nLet me think. Maybe I can consider the ratios of the equations.\n\nFrom equation 1: \\( a^3 = c(a - b^2) \\)\nFrom equation 2: \\( b^3 = a(b - c^2) \\)\nFrom equation 3: \\( c^3 = b(c - a^2) \\)\n\nLet me take the product of all three equations:\n\n\\( a^3 b^3 c^3 = c(a - b^2) \\cdot a(b - c^2) \\cdot b(c - a^2) \\)\n\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\n\\( a b c (a - b^2)(b - c^2)(c - a^2) \\)\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\\( (a b c)^3 = a b c (a - b^2)(b - c^2)(c - a^2) \\)\n\nAssuming \\( a b c \\neq 0 \\) (since we already considered the case when any is zero), we can divide both sides by \\( a b c \\):\n\n\\( (a b c)^2 = (a - b^2)(b - c^2)(c - a^2) \\)\n\nHmm, this seems complicated, but maybe if I let \\( a b c = k \\), then:\n\n\\( k^2 = (a - b^2)(b - c^2)(c - a^2) \\)\n\nNot sure if this helps. Maybe another approach.\n\nLet me consider the possibility that \\( a = b^", "answer": "\\((a, b, c) = (0, 0, 0), \\ (a, b, c) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}\\right).\\)  \n\nJeśli \\(a = 0\\), to z drugiego równania otrzymujemy \\(b = 0\\).  \nPodobnie, jeśli \\(b = 0\\), to z trzeciego równania dostajemy \\(c = 0\\), a jeśli  \n\\(c = 0\\), to pierwsze równanie daje \\(a = 0\\). Zatem wszystkie niewiadome  \nsą jednocześnie zerowe lub jednocześnie niezerowe. Oczywiście trójka  \n\\((a, b, c) = (0, 0, 0)\\) spełnia układ.  \n\nOd teraz zakładamy, że \\(a, b, c \\neq 0\\). Pomnóżmy pierwsze równanie  \nprzez \\(b\\), drugie przez \\(c\\), a trzecie przez \\(a\\). Otrzymujemy:  \n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}  \na^3b + b^3c = abc \\\\  \nb^3c + c^3a = abc \\\\  \nc^3a + a^3b = abc \\\\  \n\\end{cases}\n\\]  \n\nPo dodaniu tych równań stronami dostajemy:  \n\n\\[\n2(a^3b + b^3c + c^3a) = 3abc.  \n\\]\n\nStąd obliczamy:  \n\n\\[\na^3b = (a^3b + b^3c + c^3a) - (b^3c + c^3a) = \\frac{3}{2}abc - abc = \\frac{1}{2}abc.  \n\\]\n\nZatem \\(2a^2 = c\\).

The condition is that for any two marked points (x, y) and (x', y'), at least one of two things must be true:\n\n1. x > x' - 10 and y > y' - 10\n2. x' > x - 10 and y' > y - 10\n\nHmm, let me try to understand what this means. It seems like for any two points, one must be \"sufficiently to the right and above\" the other, or vice versa. So, if I imagine two points on the grid, they can't both be too far to the left and below each other. That is, if one point is far to the left and low, the other can't be too far to the right and high without violating the condition.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of ordering. If I arrange the points in some order, say, by their x-coordinates, then for each point, the next point must be within 10 units in both x and y directions? Or maybe not exactly, but something like that.\n\nLet me try to rephrase the condition. For any two points, either:\n\n- The first point is to the right and above the second point minus 10 in both coordinates, or\n- The second point is to the right and above the first point minus 10 in both coordinates.\n\nSo, if I consider the grid, each point must be within a 10x10 square relative to any other point? Or maybe not exactly, but in some way that they can't be too far apart in both x and y.\n\nWait, perhaps it's similar to a concept in combinatorics called a \"no two points are too far apart in both dimensions.\" Maybe it's related to the concept of a grid where points are arranged such that they form a kind of chain where each subsequent point is within a certain range of the previous one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's similar to a permutation where each element is within a certain distance from its position. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think about smaller grids to get an idea. Suppose instead of 106, the grid is smaller, say 20x20, and the condition is that for any two points, one is within 10 units in both x and y of the other. Wait, no, the condition is a bit different. It's not that they are within 10 units, but that one is greater than the other minus 10 in both coordinates.\n\nSo, for two points (x, y) and (x', y'), either x > x' - 10 and y > y' - 10, or the reverse. So, if I rearrange the inequalities:\n\nEither x - x' > -10 and y - y' > -10, or x' - x > -10 and y' - y > -10.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nEither (x - x') > -10 and (y - y') > -10, or (x' - x) > -10 and (y' - y) > -10.\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\nEither (x - x') > -10 and (y - y') > -10, or (x' - x) > -10 and (y' - y) > -10.\n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think differently. If I fix a point (x, y), then any other point (x', y') must satisfy either:\n\n1. x' < x + 10 and y' < y + 10, or\n2. x' > x - 10 and y' > y - 10.\n\nWait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me re-examine the original condition.\n\nThe condition is that for any two points, either:\n\n1. x > x' - 10 and y > y' - 10, which can be rewritten as x' < x + 10 and y' < y + 10.\n\nOr,\n\n2. x' > x - 10 and y' > y - 10, which is x < x' + 10 and y < y' + 10.\n\nSo, for any two points, one must lie in the rectangle defined by (x - 10, y - 10) to (x + 10, y + 10) of the other.\n\nWait, that's an interesting way to put it. So, each point must lie within a 20x20 square centered at the other point. But actually, it's a bit different because it's not a square but a rectangle extending 10 units in all directions.\n\nBut actually, the condition is that for any two points, one is in the 10x10 square to the right and above the other, or vice versa.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of forbidden configurations. If two points are such that neither is to the right and above the other minus 10, then they can't both be in the set. So, if I have two points where x <= x' - 10 and y <= y' - 10, then they can't both be marked.\n\nSo, the forbidden pairs are those where one point is at least 10 units to the left and 10 units below the other.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to selecting a set of points where no two points are such that one is at least 10 units left and 10 units below the other.\n\nThis seems similar to a problem where we need to avoid certain configurations, and we want the largest possible set.\n\nI recall that in such problems, sometimes the maximum size is related to the size of the grid divided by the forbidden distance, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as a graph where each point is a vertex, and edges connect points that are forbidden to be both selected. Then, the problem becomes finding the maximum independent set in this graph.\n\nBut maximum independent set is generally hard, but maybe the graph has a special structure that allows us to compute it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can partition the grid into regions where within each region, no two points are forbidden, and then take one point from each region.\n\nWait, if we partition the grid into blocks where each block is 10x10, then within each block, any two points are within 10 units in both x and y, so they don't violate the condition. But actually, the forbidden condition is about being at least 10 units apart in both directions, so if we partition the grid into 10x10 blocks, then points in the same block are within 10 units, but points in different blocks could still be forbidden if they are in blocks that are at least one block apart in both x and y.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nIf I divide the grid into 10x10 blocks, starting from (1,1) to (10,10), (11,1) to (20,10), etc., then any two points in the same block are within 9 units in both x and y, so they don't violate the condition. However, points in different blocks could still be forbidden if their blocks are at least one block apart in both x and y.\n\nWait, but if two points are in blocks that are at least one block apart in both x and y, then their x-coordinates differ by at least 10, and their y-coordinates differ by at least 10, so they would be forbidden.\n\nTherefore, if we select at most one point from each such 10x10 block, we can ensure that no two points are forbidden. But is this the maximum?\n\nWait, but maybe we can do better. Because even within a block, if we select multiple points, as long as they don't have one point being at least 10 units left and below another.\n\nBut within a 10x10 block, the maximum difference in x or y is 9, so no two points within the same block can be forbidden. So, actually, within each 10x10 block, we can select as many points as we want, because they can't be forbidden.\n\nWait, that's a key insight. So, if we partition the grid into 10x10 blocks, then within each block, any two points are within 9 units in both x and y, so they don't violate the condition. Therefore, we can select all points within each block, but we have to ensure that points in different blocks don't violate the condition.\n\nWait, but if we select points from multiple blocks, we have to make sure that no two points from different blocks are such that one is at least 10 units left and below the other.\n\nSo, for example, if I select a point from block (i, j), then I cannot select any point from block (i', j') where i' <= i - 1 and j' <= j - 1, because those blocks are at least 10 units left and below.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to selecting a set of blocks such that no two selected blocks are in the lower-left of each other by at least one block in both x and y directions.\n\nThis is similar to selecting a set of blocks where no two blocks are in a \"southeast\" relation, meaning that if you have a block, you can't have another block that is both to the left and below it.\n\nWait, actually, it's the opposite. If you select a block, you can't select any block that is to the left and below it. So, the set of selected blocks must form an antichain in the grid poset, where the order is defined by being to the right and above.\n\nIn poset terminology, an antichain is a set of elements where no two are comparable. In this case, comparability is defined by one block being to the right and above another.\n\nSo, the maximum number of blocks we can select without any two being comparable is given by Dilworth's theorem, which states that in any finite poset, the size of the largest antichain equals the minimum number of chains needed to cover the poset.\n\nBut in this case, the poset is a grid, and the maximum antichain in a grid poset is given by the number of elements in the middle layer, which for an n x n grid is roughly n.\n\nWait, but our grid is 106x106, partitioned into 10x10 blocks, so how many blocks do we have?\n\n106 divided by 10 is 10.6, so we have 11 blocks in each direction, right? Because 10*10=100, so the 11th block would be from 101 to 106.\n\nSo, the grid is partitioned into 11x11 blocks, each of size 10x10 except the last ones which are smaller.\n\nWait, actually, 106 divided by 10 is 10 with a remainder of 6, so in each direction, we have 11 blocks: 10 blocks of size 10 and one block of size 6.\n\nSo, the grid is divided into 11x11 blocks.\n\nNow, in this 11x11 grid of blocks, we need to select an antichain, meaning no two blocks are comparable, i.e., no two blocks where one is to the right and above the other.\n\nThe maximum antichain in an 11x11 grid poset is given by the number of blocks in the middle row or column, which is 11.\n\nWait, no, actually, in a grid poset, the maximum antichain is equal to the width of the poset, which for an n x n grid is n. But in our case, it's 11x11, so the maximum antichain is 11.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right because in a grid poset, the maximum antichain is actually the number of elements in the middle layer, which for an n x n grid is n. So, for 11x11, it's 11.\n\nBut wait, actually, in a grid poset, the maximum antichain is equal to the number of elements in the largest rank, which for an n x n grid is n. So, in our case, 11.\n\nBut wait, that seems too small because each block can contain up to 10x10=100 points, so 11 blocks would give 1100 points, but the total grid is 106x106=11236 points, so 1100 is much smaller.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Let me think again.\n\nIf we partition the grid into 11x11 blocks, each block can contribute multiple points, but we can only select points from blocks that form an antichain. So, if we select 11 blocks, each contributing up to 100 points, that's 1100 points. But maybe we can do better by selecting more blocks, but ensuring that no two are comparable.\n\nWait, no, because if we select more than 11 blocks, some of them would have to be comparable, which is not allowed.\n\nWait, but actually, in the poset of blocks, the maximum antichain is 11, so we can select at most 11 blocks. But each block can have up to 10x10=100 points, so 11*100=1100 points.\n\nBut wait, the last block in each direction is only 6 units, so the last block in x is from 101 to 106, which is 6 units, and similarly for y. So, the last block is 6x6=36 points.\n\nSo, if we select the antichain blocks, some of them might be the last block, which has only 36 points.\n\nBut to maximize the number of points, we should select the blocks with the maximum number of points, which are the first 10 blocks in each direction, each with 100 points.\n\nWait, but the antichain can include any blocks, not necessarily the first ones. So, perhaps the maximum antichain is 11 blocks, each of which can have up to 100 points, except the last one which has 36.\n\nBut actually, the antichain can be arranged such that we select the blocks in a diagonal, so that each block is in a different row and column, thus avoiding comparability.\n\nWait, in an 11x11 grid, the maximum antichain is indeed 11, as per Dilworth's theorem, because the poset can be covered by 11 chains, each corresponding to a diagonal.\n\nSo, if we select 11 blocks, each in a different row and column, then we can have 11 blocks, each contributing up to 100 points, except the last one", "answer": "**Niech** \\( X \\) **będzie zbiorem spełniającym warunki zadania.

Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nLet me try to parse this. So, we have variables \\(x_i\\) which are binary, taking values -1 or 1. The expression is a quadratic form in these variables, and it's constrained to output only -1 or 1 regardless of the input. The question is about the maximum number of non-zero coefficients \\(a_{ij}\\) in such a form.\n\nFirst, I should recall that quadratic forms can be represented as matrices. Specifically, the expression \\(\\sum_{i < j} a_{ij}x_i x_j\\) can be written as \\(\\mathbf{x}^T A \\mathbf{x}\\), where \\(A\\) is a symmetric matrix with zeros on the diagonal and \\(a_{ij}\\) on the off-diagonal entries. But in this case, since we're only considering \\(i < j\\), the matrix is strictly upper triangular, but since quadratic forms are symmetric, it's effectively a symmetric matrix with \\(a_{ij}\\) and \\(a_{ji}\\) equal.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, it's given that \\(a_{ij}\\) are real numbers, and the sum is over \\(i < j\\). So, each term \\(a_{ij}x_i x_j\\) is included once. So, the quadratic form is actually half of the symmetric matrix, but since each \\(x_i x_j\\) is symmetric, the entire expression is symmetric.\n\nNow, the key condition is that for any choice of \\(x_i \\in \\{-1, 1\\}\\), the sum is either -1 or 1. So, regardless of how we choose the \\(x_i\\), the quadratic form only takes two possible values: -1 or 1.\n\nI need to find the maximum number of non-zero \\(a_{ij}\\)s. So, the question is about the sparsity of the matrix \\(A\\). The more non-zero entries, the denser the matrix, but the condition restricts how dense it can be.\n\nLet me think about small cases first. Maybe that will help me see a pattern.\n\nCase 1: n = 2.\n\nHere, we have only one term: \\(a_{12}x_1 x_2\\). The sum is just \\(a_{12}x_1 x_2\\). Since \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) are each either -1 or 1, their product is also either -1 or 1. So, the sum can be either \\(a_{12}\\) or \\(-a_{12}\\). The condition is that this must be either -1 or 1. So, \\(a_{12}\\) must be either 1 or -1. Therefore, the maximum number of non-zero \\(a_{ij}\\) is 1.\n\nCase 2: n = 3.\n\nNow, we have three terms: \\(a_{12}x_1x_2 + a_{13}x_1x_3 + a_{23}x_2x_3\\). The sum must be either -1 or 1 for any choice of \\(x_1, x_2, x_3 \\in \\{-1, 1\\}\\).\n\nLet me consider all possible combinations. There are \\(2^3 = 8\\) possible assignments for \\(x_1, x_2, x_3\\). For each assignment, the sum must be either -1 or 1.\n\nLet me denote the quadratic form as \\(Q = a_{12}x_1x_2 + a_{13}x_1x_3 + a_{23}x_2x_3\\).\n\nI need to choose \\(a_{12}, a_{13}, a_{23}\\) such that \\(Q \\in \\{-1, 1\\}\\) for all 8 possible inputs.\n\nWhat's the maximum number of non-zero \\(a_{ij}\\)s? Let's see.\n\nSuppose all three \\(a_{ij}\\) are non-zero. Is that possible?\n\nLet me try to see if such a choice exists.\n\nSuppose \\(a_{12} = a_{13} = a_{23} = 1\\). Then, let's compute Q for different inputs.\n\nTake \\(x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = 1\\). Then, Q = 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 = 3. That's not allowed, since it's 3, not -1 or 1. So, that doesn't work.\n\nWhat if I set two of them to 1 and one to -1? Let's say \\(a_{12}=1\\), \\(a_{13}=1\\), \\(a_{23}=-1\\).\n\nCompute Q for \\(x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = 1\\): 1 + 1 -1 = 1. Good.\n\nFor \\(x_1 = 1, x_2 = 1, x_3 = -1\\): 1*1 + 1*(-1) + (-1)*(-1) = 1 -1 +1 = 1. Good.\n\nFor \\(x_1 = 1, x_2 = -1, x_3 = 1\\): 1*(-1) + 1*1 + (-1)*(-1) = -1 +1 +1 = 1.

Then, Q = x1x2 + x1x3.\n\nLet's compute Q for all 8 cases:\n\n1. x1=1, x2=1, x3=1: 1 + 1 = 2. Not allowed.\n\nSo, that's already a problem. So, even with two non-zero coefficients, it's not possible.\n\nWait, maybe if I set one coefficient to 1 and the others to 0. Then, Q would be either 1 or -1, which is allowed.

For n=3, is it possible to have two non-zero coefficients?\n\nWait, let's try \\(a_{12}=1\\), \\(a_{13}=1\\), \\(a_{23}=0\\).

So, that's one non-zero coefficient.\n\nBut is there a way to have two non-zero coefficients?\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe set \\(a_{12}=1\\), \\(a_{13}=1\\), and \\(a_{23}=1\\), but then scale them down. For example, set each \\(a_{ij} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\).

So, that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set \\(a_{12}=1\\), \\(a_{13}=1\\), \\(a_{23}=1\\), but then the sum can be 3, which is too big. So, that's not allowed.\n\nWait, maybe if I set two coefficients to 1 and one to -1, but in such a way that the sum never exceeds 1 or goes below -1.\n\nWait, let's try \\(a_{12}=1\\), \\(a_{13}=1\\), \\(a_{23}=-1\\). Then, let's compute Q for all 8 cases:\n\n1. x1=1, x2=1, x3=1: 1 + 1 -1 = 1. Good.\n2. x1=1, x2=1, x3=-1: 1 + (-1) + 1 = 1. Good.\n3. x1=1, x2=-1, x3=1: (-1) + 1 + 1 = 1. Good.\n4. x1=1, x2=-1, x3=-1: (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1. Good.\n5. x1=-1, x2=1, x3=1: (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1. Good.\n6. x1=-1, x2=1, x3=-1: (-1) + 1 + (-1) = -1. Good.\n7. x1=-1, x2=-1, x3=1: 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1. Good.\n8. x1=-1, x2=-1, x3=-1: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. Oh no, that's 3, which is not allowed.\n\nSo, that doesn't work either.

Then, Q is either 1 or -1, which is allowed, but only one non-zero coefficient.\n\nHmm, so maybe for n=3, the maximum number of non-zero coefficients is 1? But that seems too restrictive.

Let me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, \\( A_{m,n} \\) is defined as the set of vectors \\( (k, l) \\) where \\( 0 \\leq k \\leq m-1 \\) and \\( 0 \\leq l \\leq n-1 \\). So, essentially, \\( A_{m,n} \\) is a grid of points with \\( m \\) columns and \\( n \\) rows. Each point is identified by its coordinates \\( (k, l) \\).\n\nNow, a function \\( f \\) is called \"good\" if it satisfies two conditions:\n\n1. It's injective (one-to-one). That means each element in \\( A_{m,n} \\) maps to a unique element, so no two different vectors map to the same vector.\n\n2. The second condition is a bit more complex. It says that if for two vectors \\( v \\) and \\( w \\) in \\( A_{m,n} \\), the equation \\( v + f(v) - w - f(w) = (am, bn) \\) holds for some integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), then \\( v \\) must equal \\( w \\).\n\nSo, I need to figure out for which \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) such a function \\( f \\) exists.\n\nLet me try to unpack the second condition. The equation \\( v + f(v) - w - f(w) = (am, bn) \\) can be rewritten as \\( (v - w) + (f(v) - f(w)) = (am, bn) \\). This suggests that the difference between \\( v \\) and \\( w \\) plus the difference between their images under \\( f \\) must be a multiple of \\( (m, n) \\).\n\nSince \\( f \\) is injective, it's a permutation of the set \\( A_{m,n} \\). So, \\( f \\) is essentially rearranging the points in the grid without any overlaps.\n\nLet me think about what the second condition implies. If \\( v \\neq w \\), then \\( (v - w) + (f(v) - f(w)) \\) cannot be a multiple of \\( (m, n) \\). So, for any two distinct points \\( v \\) and \\( w \\), the vector \\( (v - w) + (f(v) - f(w)) \\) should not be equal to \\( (am, bn) \\) for any integers \\( a, b \\).\n\nHmm, maybe it's helpful to consider the function \\( f \\) as a kind of \"shift\" or \"permutation\" that doesn't allow certain periodicities. Since \\( A_{m,n} \\) is a grid, perhaps the function \\( f \\) needs to avoid creating any translational symmetries that would allow the difference to wrap around the grid.\n\nWait, another way to look at it is that the function \\( f \\) should not allow any non-zero vectors \\( v - w \\) such that \\( f(v) - f(w) = (am, bn) - (v - w) \\). So, if \\( f \\) is a permutation, then \\( f(v) - f(w) \\) is just another vector in the grid, but it can't be equal to \\( (am, bn) - (v - w) \\) unless \\( v = w \\).\n\nThis seems related to the concept of a \"complete mapping\" or something similar in combinatorics. Maybe I need to ensure that the function \\( f \\) doesn't create any non-trivial solutions to the equation \\( f(v) - f(w) = (am, bn) - (v - w) \\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as a graph problem. If I consider each point in \\( A_{m,n} \\) as a vertex, and draw edges based on the function \\( f \\), then the second condition is preventing certain cycles or paths that would correspond to the equation given.\n\nBut maybe stepping back, let's consider small cases to get some intuition.\n\nLet's start with \\( m = 1 \\) and \\( n = 1 \\). Then \\( A_{1,1} \\) has only one point, \\( (0,0) \\). The function \\( f \\) must map this point to itself. The second condition is trivially satisfied because there are no two distinct points. So, \\( m = 1, n = 1 \\) works.\n\nNext, consider \\( m = 2 \\) and \\( n = 1 \\). So, \\( A_{2,1} \\) has two points: \\( (0,0) \\) and \\( (1,0) \\). The function \\( f \\) must be a permutation of these two points. Let's see if the second condition holds.\n\nSuppose \\( f \\) swaps the two points. So, \\( f(0,0) = (1,0) \\) and \\( f(1,0) = (0,0) \\). Now, let's check the second condition. Take \\( v = (0,0) \\) and \\( w = (1,0) \\). Then \\( v + f(v) - w - f(w) = (0,0) + (1,0) - (1,0) - (0,0) = (0,0) \\). So, \\( (am, bn) = (0,0) \\), which implies \\( a = 0 \\) and \\( b = 0 \\). But since \\( v \\neq w \\), this would violate the second condition because \\( v + f(v) - w - f(w) = (0,0) \\) which is \\( (0m, 0n) \\), but \\( v \\neq w \\). Therefore, this function \\( f \\) is not \"good\".\n\nWait, so swapping the two points doesn't work. What if \\( f \\) is the identity function? Then \\( f(v) = v \\) for all \\( v \\). Then \\( v + f(v) - w - f(w) = 2v - 2w \\). For \\( v \\neq w \\), this would be \\( 2(v - w) \\). Since \\( m = 2 \\) and \\( n = 1 \\), \\( 2(v - w) \\) would be \\( (2k, 0) \\) for some integer \\( k \\). But \\( 2k \\) modulo 2 is 0, so \\( 2(v - w) \\) is a multiple of \\( (2, 0) \\). So, \\( (am, bn) = (2a, b) \\). So, if \\( 2(v - w) = (2a, b) \\), then \\( b \\) must be 0 because \\( v - w \\) in the second coordinate is 0 (since \\( n = 1 \\)). So, \\( 2(v - w) = (2a, 0) \\). But \\( v - w \\) is either \\( (1, 0) \\) or \\( (-1, 0) \\). So, \\( 2(v - w) \\) is either \\( (2, 0) \\) or \\( (-2, 0) \\), which are multiples of \\( (2, 0) \\). Therefore, \\( a = 1 \\) or \\( a = -1 \\), and \\( b = 0 \\). But since \\( v \\neq w \\), this would mean that \\( v + f(v) - w - f(w) = (2a, 0) \\), which is a multiple of \\( (2, 0) \\). Therefore, the second condition is violated because \\( v \\neq w \\) but the equation holds. So, the identity function also doesn't work.\n\nHmm, so for \\( m = 2, n = 1 \\), neither the identity nor the swap function works. Does that mean there is no \"good\" function for \\( m = 2, n = 1 \\)?\n\nWait, but \\( A_{2,1} \\) has two points, so the only possible functions are the identity and the swap. Since both don't satisfy the second condition, maybe \\( m = 2, n = 1 \\) is not possible.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nFor \\( m = 2, n = 1 \\), \\( A_{2,1} = \\{(0,0), (1,0)\\} \\).\n\nIf \\( f \\) is the identity function, then for \\( v = (0,0) \\) and \\( w = (1,0) \\), we have \\( v + f(v) - w - f(w) = (0,0) + (0,0) - (1,0) - (1,0) = (-2, 0) \\). So, \\( (-2, 0) = (am, bn) = (2a, b) \\). So, \\( 2a = -2 \\) implies \\( a = -1 \\), and \\( b = 0 \\). So, indeed, \\( v + f(v) - w - f(w) = (2a, bn) \\) with \\( a = -1, b = 0 \\), but \\( v \\neq w \\). Therefore, the identity function doesn't satisfy the second condition.\n\nSimilarly, if \\( f \\) swaps the points, then \\( v + f(v) - w - f(w) = (0,0) + (1,0) - (1,0) - (0,0) = (0,0) \\), which is \\( (0m, 0n) \\), so \\( a = 0, b = 0 \\), but \\( v \\neq w \\). So, again, the second condition is violated.\n\nTherefore, for \\( m = 2, n = 1 \\), there is no \"good\" function. So, \\( m = 2, n = 1 \\) is not a valid pair.\n\nWait, but maybe I need to consider that \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) can be any integers, not necessarily positive. So, in the case of the identity function, \\( a = -1 \\) is allowed, which still violates the condition.\n\nSo, perhaps for \\( m = 2, n = 1 \\), no such function exists.\n\nLet me try \\( m = 1, n = 2 \\). Similarly, \\( A_{1,2} = \\{(0,0), (0,1)\\} \\). The same logic applies. If \\( f \\) is the identity, then for \\( v = (0,0) \\) and \\( w = (0,1) \\), \\( v + f(v) - w - f(w) = (0,0) + (0,0) - (0,1) - (0,1) = (0, -2) \\). So, \\( (0, -2) = (a*1, b*2) \\). So, \\( a = 0 \\), \\( b = -1 \\). Thus, \\( v + f(v) - w - f(w) = (0, -2) = (0, 2*(-1)) \\), which is a multiple of \\( (1, 2) \\) scaled by \\( a = 0, b = -1 \\). But \\( v \\neq w \\), so the second condition is violated.\n\nIf \\( f \\) swaps the two points, then \\( v + f(v) - w - f(w) = (0,0) + (0,1) - (0,1) - (0,0) = (0,0) \\), which is \\( (0,0) = (0*1, 0*2) \\), so again, \\( v \\neq w \\) but the equation holds. So, no good function exists for \\( m = 1, n = 2 \\) either.\n\nHmm, so maybe when either \\( m \\) or \\( n \\) is 1, except for \\( m = n = 1 \\), there is no good function.\n\nWait, let's check \\( m = 1, n = 1 \\). As before, it's trivially good because there's only one point.\n\nWhat about \\( m = 2, n = 2 \\)? Let's see.\n\n\\( A_{2,2} \\) has four points: \\( (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) \\).\n\nWe need to find a permutation \\( f \\) of these four points such that for any two distinct points \\( v, w \\), \\( v + f(v) - w - f(w) \\) is not a multiple of \\( (2, 2) \\).\n\nWait, actually, the condition is that if \\( v + f(v) - w - f(w) = (2a, 2b) \\), then \\( v = w \\).\n\nSo, for \\( m = 2, n = 2 \\), the vector \\( (2a, 2b) \\) would be \\( (0,0) \\) or \\( (2,0), (0,2), (2,2) \\), etc., but since we're working modulo \\( m \\) and \\( n \\), perhaps the differences wrap around.\n\nWait, no, the equation is in integers, not modulo. So, \\( v + f(v) - w - f(w) \\) must not be equal to \\( (2a, 2b) \\) unless \\( v = w \\).\n\nSo, let's try to construct such a function \\( f \\).\n\nOne approach is to look for a permutation where the differences \\( f(v) - v \\) are all distinct modulo \\( (2, 2) \\). Because if \\( f(v) - v \\) are distinct modulo \\( (2, 2) \\), then \\( f(v) - v \\neq f(w) - w \\) modulo \\( (2, 2) \\) for \\( v \\neq w \\), which would imply that \\( v + f(v) - w - f(w) \\) is not a multiple of \\( (2, 2) \\).\n\nWait, let me think. If \\( f(v) - v \\) are all distinct modulo \\( (2, 2) \\), then for any \\( v \\neq w \\), \\( f(v) - v \\neq f(w) - w \\) modulo \\( (2, 2) \\). Therefore, \\( f(v) - v - (f(w) - w) \\neq (0, 0) \\) modulo \\( (2, 2) \\), which implies that \\( f(v) - f(w) - (v - w) \\neq (0, 0) \\) modulo \\( (2, 2) \\). Therefore, \\( f(v) - f(w) \\neq v - w \\) modulo \\( (2, 2) \\). So,", "answer": "Parę \\( (n, m) \\) nazwiemy dobrą, jeśli istnieje dobra funkcja \\( f : A_{n,m} \\to A_{n,m} \\).

Each rectangle has sides parallel to the axes. The conditions are that for each \\( i \\), \\( A_i \\) and \\( B_i \\) are disjoint, but for any \\( i \\neq j \\), \\( A_i \\) and \\( B_j \\) must intersect. \n\nHmm, let me try to visualize this. So, each \\( A_i \\) doesn't overlap with its corresponding \\( B_i \\), but every other \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) must share at least one point. That seems a bit tricky. Maybe I can start with smaller values of \\( n \\) and see how it works.\n\nLet's consider \\( n = 1 \\). That's trivial because we just have one \\( A_1 \\) and one \\( B_1 \\), which are disjoint. But the problem is about the maximum \\( n \\), so I need to go higher.\n\nFor \\( n = 2 \\), I can imagine two pairs of rectangles. Each \\( A_i \\) doesn't overlap with \\( B_i \\), but \\( A_1 \\) must intersect with \\( B_2 \\) and \\( A_2 \\) must intersect with \\( B_1 \\). I can draw this: maybe \\( A_1 \\) is on the left, \\( B_1 \\) is on the right, \\( A_2 \\) is on the top, and \\( B_2 \\) is on the bottom. Then, \\( A_1 \\) and \\( B_2 \\) would intersect somewhere in the middle, and similarly \\( A_2 \\) and \\( B_1 \\) would intersect in the middle. So, \\( n = 2 \\) is possible.\n\nMoving on to \\( n = 3 \\). I need three pairs of rectangles. Each \\( A_i \\) must not overlap with \\( B_i \\), but every other pair \\( A_i \\) and \\( B_j \\) must intersect. This is getting more complex. Maybe arranging them in a grid? Let me think.\n\nPerhaps arranging the \\( A \\) rectangles in a way that each one is in a different row and column, and the \\( B \\) rectangles are arranged similarly but shifted so they don't overlap with their corresponding \\( A \\). But ensuring that every \\( A_i \\) intersects with every \\( B_j \\) where \\( i \\neq j \\) is challenging.\n\nWait, maybe using a diagonal arrangement. If I place each \\( A_i \\) along the diagonal, and each \\( B_i \\) also along the diagonal but shifted so they don't overlap. Then, for \\( i \\neq j \\), \\( A_i \\) and \\( B_j \\) would intersect because they are on different diagonals. Hmm, not sure if that works.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using overlapping regions. For each \\( A_i \\), it's placed such that it covers a unique area, and each \\( B_j \\) is placed to cover all areas except the one corresponding to \\( B_i \\). But I need to make sure that \\( A_i \\) and \\( B_j \\) intersect for all \\( i \\neq j \\).\n\nWait, maybe this is related to something called the \"piercing problem\" or something in combinatorics. I remember that in such problems, the maximum number of sets that can be arranged so that each pair intersects but certain conditions hold. Maybe it's similar to the concept of a projective plane or something else.\n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of graph theory. If I model each \\( A_i \\) and \\( B_i \\) as nodes, with edges representing intersections, but I'm not sure if that directly helps.\n\nWait, another approach: think of each \\( A_i \\) as a horizontal rectangle and each \\( B_i \\) as a vertical rectangle. If I arrange them such that each \\( A_i \\) is horizontal and doesn't overlap with \\( B_i \\), but overlaps with all other \\( B_j \\). Similarly, each \\( B_i \\) is vertical and doesn't overlap with \\( A_i \\), but overlaps with all other \\( A_j \\).\n\nSo, for example, if I have \\( n \\) horizontal rectangles \\( A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_n \\) and \\( n \\) vertical rectangles \\( B_1, B_2, \\dots, B_n \\). Each \\( A_i \\) is placed such that it doesn't intersect \\( B_i \\), but intersects all other \\( B_j \\). Similarly, each \\( B_i \\) doesn't intersect \\( A_i \\) but intersects all other \\( A_j \\).\n\nHow can I arrange them? Maybe each \\( A_i \\) is a horizontal strip that covers all vertical positions except where \\( B_i \\) is. Similarly, each \\( B_i \\) is a vertical strip that covers all horizontal positions except where \\( A_i \\) is.\n\nWait, but if each \\( A_i \\) is a horizontal strip missing a certain vertical position, and each \\( B_i \\) is a vertical strip missing a certain horizontal position, then \\( A_i \\) and \\( B_j \\) would intersect unless \\( i = j \\). Because \\( A_i \\) is missing the vertical position of \\( B_i \\), so \\( A_i \\) and \\( B_i \\) don't intersect, but \\( A_i \\) and \\( B_j \\) (for \\( j \\neq i \\)) would intersect because \\( A_i \\) covers all vertical positions except \\( B_i \\)'s, and \\( B_j \\) is a vertical strip that covers all horizontal positions except \\( A_j \\)'s. So, as long as \\( A_i \\) is not missing the horizontal position of \\( B_j \\), which it isn't because \\( A_i \\) only misses \\( B_i \\)'s vertical position, and \\( B_j \\) only misses \\( A_j \\)'s horizontal position.\n\nWait, maybe I need to formalize this. Let's assign coordinates. Let me think of each \\( A_i \\) as a horizontal rectangle covering the entire plane except a vertical strip where \\( B_i \\) is. Similarly, each \\( B_i \\) is a vertical rectangle covering the entire plane except a horizontal strip where \\( A_i \\) is.\n\nBut actually, rectangles can't cover the entire plane, so maybe I need to adjust. Instead, each \\( A_i \\) is a horizontal rectangle that spans the entire height except a small vertical gap where \\( B_i \\) is placed. Similarly, each \\( B_i \\) is a vertical rectangle spanning the entire width except a small horizontal gap where \\( A_i \\) is placed.\n\nSo, for example, if I have \\( n \\) horizontal rectangles \\( A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_n \\), each missing a different vertical position, and \\( n \\) vertical rectangles \\( B_1, B_2, \\dots, B_n \\), each missing a different horizontal position. Then, \\( A_i \\) and \\( B_i \\) don't intersect because \\( A_i \\) is missing the vertical position of \\( B_i \\), and \\( B_i \\) is missing the horizontal position of \\( A_i \\). But for \\( i \\neq j \\), \\( A_i \\) is not missing the vertical position of \\( B_j \\), and \\( B_j \\) is not missing the horizontal position of \\( A_i \\), so they must intersect.\n\nThis seems to work. So, in this arrangement, each \\( A_i \\) is a horizontal rectangle that covers all vertical positions except one, and each \\( B_i \\) is a vertical rectangle that covers all horizontal positions except one. Therefore, \\( A_i \\) and \\( B_j \\) intersect for all \\( i \\neq j \\), and \\( A_i \\) and \\( B_i \\) do not intersect.\n\nBut how many such rectangles can we have? Is there a limit? Because in theory, we can have as many as we want, but the problem is on the plane, so maybe the limit is related to the dimensionality.\n\nWait, no, because each \\( A_i \\) is a horizontal rectangle, so they can be arranged along the x-axis, each missing a different y-coordinate. Similarly, each \\( B_i \\) is a vertical rectangle missing a different x-coordinate. So, in theory, we can have as many as we want, but the problem is that the rectangles must be axis-aligned and finite.\n\nWait, but in reality, each rectangle has finite extent, so we can't have infinitely many. So, maybe the maximum \\( n \\) is related to the number of dimensions or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps this is similar to the concept of a bipartite graph where each \\( A_i \\) is connected to all \\( B_j \\) except \\( B_i \\). The question is, what's the maximum \\( n \\) such that this can be represented with axis-aligned rectangles.\n\nI recall that in such intersection problems, the maximum \\( n \\) is often 4, but I'm not sure. Let me think.\n\nWait, another approach: think of each \\( A_i \\) as a row in a grid and each \\( B_i \\) as a column. Then, \\( A_i \\) and \\( B_j \\) intersect at the cell (i,j). But \\( A_i \\) and \\( B_i \\) would intersect at (i,i), but we need them to be disjoint. So, maybe if we remove the diagonal cells, but then \\( A_i \\) and \\( B_j \\) would still intersect elsewhere.\n\nWait, no, because if \\( A_i \\) is a row missing the cell (i,i), and \\( B_i \\) is a column missing the cell (i,i), then \\( A_i \\) and \\( B_i \\) don't intersect, but \\( A_i \\) and \\( B_j \\) (for \\( j \\neq i \\)) do intersect at (i,j). So, in this case, \\( n \\) can be as large as the number of rows and columns, which is theoretically infinite, but since we're on the plane, we can't have infinite rectangles.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify that the rectangles have to be finite in size, just that they are axis-aligned. So, maybe we can have infinitely many, but the problem asks for the largest positive integer \\( n \\), implying it's finite.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the maximum \\( n \\) is 4. Let me think of a specific example.\n\nSuppose we have 4 pairs of rectangles. Each \\( A_i \\) is a horizontal rectangle missing a vertical strip, and each \\( B_i \\) is a vertical rectangle missing a horizontal strip. So, for \\( n = 4 \\), we can arrange them such that each \\( A_i \\) and \\( B_j \\) intersect for \\( i \\neq j \\), but \\( A_i \\) and \\( B_i \\) don't.\n\nBut can we go higher? Let's try \\( n = 5 \\). If I try to arrange 5 horizontal and 5 vertical rectangles, each missing a different strip, would that work? I think it would, but maybe there's a limit due to the plane's properties.\n\nWait, no, because each rectangle is just a strip missing a point, so theoretically, you can have as many as you want. But the problem is that the rectangles must be placed on the plane without overlapping their corresponding \\( B_i \\), but intersecting all others.\n\nWait, but in reality, each \\( A_i \\) is a horizontal strip missing a vertical line, and each \\( B_i \\) is a vertical strip missing a horizontal line. So, as long as the missing lines are distinct, they can be arranged without overlapping their corresponding \\( B_i \\).\n\nBut wait, if I have \\( n \\) horizontal strips each missing a different vertical line, and \\( n \\) vertical strips each missing a different horizontal line, then for each \\( i \\), \\( A_i \\) and \\( B_i \\) don't intersect because \\( A_i \\) is missing the vertical line where \\( B_i \\) is, and \\( B_i \\) is missing the horizontal line where \\( A_i \\) is. But for \\( i \\neq j \\), \\( A_i \\) is not missing the vertical line of \\( B_j \\), and \\( B_j \\) is not missing the horizontal line of \\( A_i \\), so they must intersect.\n\nTherefore, this construction works for any \\( n \\). But the problem is asking for the largest positive integer \\( n \\). Wait, but the problem doesn't specify any constraints on the size or number of rectangles, just that they are on the plane. So, does that mean \\( n \\) can be infinite? But the problem says \"największą dodatnią liczbę całkowitą\", which is the largest positive integer, implying it's finite.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.\n\n\"Na płaszczyźnie istnieją takie prosto... każdy o bokach równoległych do osi układu współrzędnych, że prosto... są rozłączne dla wszystkich \\( i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\} \\), ale prosto... mają punkt wspólny dla wszystkich \\( i, j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}, i \\neq j \\).\"\n\nSo, it's about the existence of such rectangles on the plane. So, maybe the maximum \\( n \\) is 4 because of some geometric constraint.\n\nWait, another thought: in the plane, the maximum number of rectangles where each pair intersects except for one specific pair is limited by the dimension. Maybe it's related to the dimension of the space, which is 2, so the maximum \\( n \\) is 4.\n\nWait, I think I remember a similar problem where the maximum number is 4. Let me try to recall.\n\nYes, in the plane, the maximum number of axis-aligned rectangles where each pair intersects except for one specific pair is 4. This is because you can arrange them in a grid-like structure where each rectangle avoids one specific other rectangle, but intersects all others.\n\nSo, for example, arrange four rectangles in such a way that each \\( A_i \\) is in a different quadrant, and each \\( B_i \\) is in a different quadrant, but arranged so that \\( A_i \\) and \\( B_i \\) don't overlap, but \\( A_i \\) and \\( B_j \\) do for \\( i \\neq j \\).\n\nWait, let me try to visualize this. Imagine four quadrants: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right. Place each \\( A_i \\) in a different quadrant, and each \\( B_i \\) in a different quadrant, but shifted so that \\( A_i \\) and \\( B_i \\) don't overlap, but \\( A_i \\) and \\( B_j \\) do for \\( i \\neq j \\).\n\nFor example, \\( A_1 \\) is a rectangle covering the top-left quadrant, but not overlapping with \\( B_1 \\), which is in the top-right. Similarly, \\( A_2 \\) is in the top-right, \\( B_2 \\) is in the bottom-right, and so on.

The goal is to find the smallest number of 3x3 tiles needed to do this without any overlaps or going beyond the board. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably calculate the total area of the chessboard. Since it's 15x15, the area is 15 multiplied by 15, which is 225 squares. Now, each 2x2 tile covers 4 squares, and each 3x3 tile covers 9 squares. So, if I let x be the number of 3x3 tiles and y be the number of 2x2 tiles, the total area covered by the tiles should be equal to 225. That gives me the equation:\n\n9x + 4y = 225\n\nI need to find the smallest possible x such that both x and y are non-negative integers. So, I can rearrange this equation to solve for y:\n\n4y = 225 - 9x  \ny = (225 - 9x)/4\n\nSince y has to be an integer, (225 - 9x) must be divisible by 4. Let me think about how to find such x. Maybe I can express 225 modulo 4 and 9x modulo 4 to see what x needs to be.\n\n225 divided by 4 is 56 with a remainder of 1, so 225 ≡ 1 mod 4. Similarly, 9x mod 4: since 9 ≡ 1 mod 4, so 9x ≡ x mod 4. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\n1 - x ≡ 0 mod 4  \nWhich simplifies to x ≡ 1 mod 4.\n\nSo x must be congruent to 1 modulo 4. That means x can be 1, 5, 9, 13, etc. But since we're looking for the smallest x, let's start with x=1 and see if it's possible.\n\nIf x=1, then y=(225 - 9)/4 = 216/4 = 54. So y=54. That means we have 1 tile of 3x3 and 54 tiles of 2x2. But wait, is this actually possible? Just because the area adds up doesn't mean the tiling is possible. I need to check if the arrangement is feasible.\n\nHmm, tiling a 15x15 board with one 3x3 tile and the rest 2x2 tiles. The problem is that 2x2 tiles can only cover even areas, but the 3x3 tile covers an odd area. However, the total area is 225, which is odd, so having one 3x3 tile (which is 9, also odd) and the rest 2x2 tiles (each 4, which is even) would result in an odd total area, which is correct. But does that mean it's possible?\n\nWait, maybe not necessarily. Because tiling isn't just about the area; it's also about the arrangement. For example, if the 3x3 tile is placed somewhere, the remaining area must be tileable with 2x2 tiles. But 2x2 tiles can't cover a single square or a 3x3 area, so maybe the remaining area after placing one 3x3 tile is 225 - 9 = 216, which is divisible by 4, so 54 tiles. But can we actually arrange 54 2x2 tiles around a single 3x3 tile on a 15x15 board?\n\nI think the problem is that the 3x3 tile might create some kind of obstruction that makes it impossible to tile the rest with 2x2 tiles. For example, if the 3x3 tile is placed in a corner, the adjacent areas might not align properly for 2x2 tiles. Maybe the board's dimensions and the tile sizes create some parity issues.\n\nWait, 15 is an odd number, and both 2 and 3 are factors of 15? No, 15 divided by 2 is 7.5, which isn't an integer, so 2 doesn't divide 15. Similarly, 3 divides 15 exactly 5 times. So, maybe the tiling is possible only if the number of 3x3 tiles is a multiple of something?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the checkerboard coloring argument. If I color the chessboard in the standard black and white pattern, each 2x2 tile will always cover 2 black and 2 white squares. Similarly, a 3x3 tile will cover 5 squares of one color and 4 of the other, since 3x3 is 9 squares, which is odd. So, the total number of black and white squares on the 15x15 board is equal because 15x15 is odd, so 113 of one color and 112 of the other.\n\nWait, 15x15 is 225 squares. So, 225 divided by 2 is 112.5, so actually, one color will have 113 squares and the other 112. Let me confirm: in a standard chessboard, the top-left corner is black, so the number of black squares is ceil(225/2) = 113, and white squares are 112.\n\nEach 2x2 tile covers 2 black and 2 white squares, so it doesn't affect the balance. Each 3x3 tile, however, covers either 5 black and 4 white or 4 black and 5 white squares, depending on where it's placed. So, each 3x3 tile changes the balance by 1 square.\n\nSince the total imbalance is 1 (113 black - 112 white = 1), the number of 3x3 tiles must be such that the total imbalance they create is 1. Each 3x3 tile contributes an imbalance of +1 or -1, depending on placement. So, the total imbalance from all 3x3 tiles must be +1.\n\nTherefore, the number of 3x3 tiles must be odd because each contributes an imbalance of 1, and we need a total of 1. So, x must be odd. That aligns with our earlier conclusion that x ≡1 mod 4, so x must be 1,5,9,...\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought x=1 might not be possible because of tiling issues. Maybe I need to check if x=1 is actually possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe x=5 is the minimal number. Let me think.\n\nIf x=1, then y=54. So, 54 2x2 tiles. But 2x2 tiles can tile any area that is a multiple of 2 in both dimensions, but the problem is that the 3x3 tile is 3x3, which is odd in both dimensions. So, when you place a 3x3 tile on the board, it might create regions that are not multiples of 2 in both dimensions, making it impossible to tile with 2x2 tiles.\n\nFor example, imagine placing a 3x3 tile in the corner. Then, the remaining area would be 15x15 minus 3x3, which is 225-9=216. But the remaining area is not a rectangle; it's more like a big rectangle with a smaller rectangle missing. Specifically, it's a 15x15 board with a 3x3 square removed from one corner. Is this shape tileable with 2x2 tiles?\n\nI think it's not possible because the remaining area would have some regions that are 3 units wide, which can't be perfectly divided by 2. For example, if you remove a 3x3 square from the corner, the adjacent areas would be 12x15 and 15x12, but the 3x3 removal creates a kind of notch that might not align with 2x2 tiles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's possible to arrange the 2x2 tiles around the 3x3 tile in such a way that they cover the remaining area. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to visualize it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps x=1 is impossible, so the next possible x is 5. Let's check x=5.\n\nIf x=5, then y=(225 - 45)/4 = 180/4=45. So y=45. So, 5 tiles of 3x3 and 45 tiles of 2x2. Now, 5 is still odd, so the imbalance would be 5, but we only need an imbalance of 1. Wait, that's a problem. Because each 3x3 tile contributes an imbalance of 1, so 5 tiles would contribute an imbalance of 5, but the total imbalance needed is 1. So, that's a problem.\n\nWait, no. Actually, each 3x3 tile can contribute either +1 or -1 imbalance, depending on where it's placed. So, if we have 5 tiles, we can arrange them such that 3 contribute +1 and 2 contribute -1, resulting in a total imbalance of +1. So, that works.\n\nBut does that mean x=5 is possible? Or is there another constraint?\n\nWait, but the problem is not just the imbalance; it's also the tiling. So, even if the imbalance is correct, the tiling might not be possible. So, maybe x=5 is possible, but I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe x=9 is the minimal number. Let me think.\n\nWait, let's go back. The key point is that the number of 3x3 tiles must be congruent to 1 mod 4, so x=1,5,9,... But also, the imbalance must be 1, so the number of 3x3 tiles must be odd. So, x must be odd and x ≡1 mod 4. So, x=1,5,9,...\n\nBut when x=1, the imbalance is 1, which is correct, but the tiling might not be possible. When x=5, the imbalance can be adjusted to 1 by having 3 tiles contributing +1 and 2 contributing -1, but again, the tiling might be an issue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal x is 5. Let me think about the tiling.\n\nAnother approach: the 15x15 board can be divided into regions that are multiples of 2 or 3. Since 15 is divisible by 3 (15=3*5), maybe it's better to use 3x3 tiles in a way that covers the entire board in multiples of 3, but since 2x2 tiles are also used, which are multiples of 2, we need a balance.\n\nWait, 15 is 3*5, so maybe the board can be divided into 5x5 blocks of 3x3 tiles, but that would require 25 3x3 tiles, which is way more than necessary. But we want the minimal number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the board can be divided into regions that are 6x6, which is divisible by both 2 and 3, but 15 isn't a multiple of 6. 15 divided by 6 is 2 with a remainder of 3. So, maybe the board can be divided into 6x6 sections and 3x3 sections.\n\nWait, 15=6+6+3, so maybe the board can be divided into three parts: two 6x15 regions and one 3x15 region. Then, the 6x15 regions can be tiled with 2x2 and 3x3 tiles, and the 3x15 region can be tiled with 3x3 tiles.\n\nBut 3x15 is 45 squares, which is divisible by 9, so 5 3x3 tiles. So, in this case, the 3x15 region would require 5 3x3 tiles. Then, the 6x15 regions can be tiled with 2x2 and 3x3 tiles. But 6x15 is 90 squares. If we use only 2x2 tiles, that would require 45 tiles, but maybe we can mix in some 3x3 tiles to reduce the number of 2x2 tiles.\n\nWait, but the goal is to minimize the number of 3x3 tiles, so maybe in the 6x15 regions, we can use as few 3x3 tiles as possible. But 6x15 is 90, which is divisible by both 2 and 3. So, 90=9*10, so 10 3x3 tiles, but that's more than necessary. Alternatively, 90=4*22 + 2, which isn't possible because 2 isn't divisible by 4. Wait, 90 divided by 4 is 22.5, which isn't an integer, so we can't tile 6x15 with only 2x2 tiles. Therefore, we need to use some 3x3 tiles in the 6x15 regions.\n\nWait, but 6x15 is 90. Let me see: 90=9a +4b, where a and b are integers. We need to find the minimal a such that 90-9a is divisible by 4.\n\nSo, 90 ≡ 2 mod 4. 9a ≡ a mod 4. So, 90 -9a ≡ 2 -a ≡0 mod4. So, 2 -a ≡0 mod4 => a ≡2 mod4. So, a can be 2,6,10,...\n\nBut since 9a ≤90, a can be up to 10. So, minimal a is 2. So, in each 6x15 region, we need at least 2 3x3 tiles. Therefore, for two 6x15 regions, that's 4 3x3 tiles. Plus the 5 3x3 tiles in the 3x15 region, total x=9.\n\nSo, in this case, x=9. Is this the minimal?\n\nWait, but earlier I thought x=5 might be possible. Maybe this approach is giving x=9, but perhaps there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire board can be divided into 3x3 and 2x2 tiles without dividing into regions. Let me think about the coloring argument again.\n\nEach 3x3 tile covers 5 of one color and 4 of the other, so each contributes a net +1 or -1. Since the total imbalance is +1, the number", "answer": "Najmniejszą liczbą płytek 3×3, dla której przykrycie z treści zadania jest możliwe jest 9."}

Wyznaczyć, w zależności od \\( n \\), największą możliwą liczbę dobrych par, jaką Jadzia może uzyskać.", "response": "Okay, so I have this problem where Jadzia needs to write numbers from 1 to 2n-1 on a board, and each number can be written in either red or blue. A pair (i, j) where i ≤ j is called \"good\" if, among the numbers from i to j, the number of blue numbers is even. I need to figure out the maximum number of such good pairs Jadzia can achieve, depending on n.\n\nHmm, let me try to break this down. First, the numbers are from 1 to 2n-1, so there are 2n-1 numbers in total. Each number is either red or blue. A pair (i, j) is good if the count of blue numbers between i and j is even. So, for each possible interval [i, j], we need to check if the number of blue numbers is even.\n\nI think the first step is to understand how many total pairs (i, j) there are. Since i can range from 1 to 2n-1 and j can range from i to 2n-1, the total number of pairs is the sum from k=1 to 2n-1 of k, which is (2n-1)(2n)/2. Let me compute that: (2n-1)(2n)/2 = (4n² - 2n)/2 = 2n² - n. So, there are 2n² - n total pairs.\n\nNow, Jadzia wants to maximize the number of good pairs, which are those where the number of blue numbers in [i, j] is even. So, she needs to choose a coloring (red or blue) for each number such that as many intervals as possible have an even number of blue numbers.\n\nI wonder if there's a pattern or a strategy for coloring the numbers that would maximize the number of such intervals. Maybe alternating colors? Or some other pattern?\n\nLet me think about smaller cases to get some intuition.\n\nCase n=1: Then the numbers are just 1. So, there's only one pair (1,1). The number of blue numbers in this interval is either 0 or 1. If Jadzia colors it blue, then the count is 1, which is odd, so the pair is not good. If she colors it red, the count is 0, which is even, so the pair is good. So, maximum good pairs is 1.\n\nCase n=2: Numbers are 1, 2, 3. Total pairs: 3 + 2 + 1 = 6.\n\nWe need to color each number red or blue to maximize the number of intervals with even blue counts.\n\nLet me try different colorings.\n\nOption 1: All red. Then every interval has 0 blue numbers, which is even. So all 6 pairs are good. That's the maximum possible.\n\nWait, but maybe that's too easy. Let me check another option.\n\nOption 2: Color 1 red, 2 blue, 3 red.\n\nNow, let's list all intervals:\n\n(1,1): 0 blue (good)\n(1,2): 1 blue (bad)\n(1,3): 1 blue (bad)\n(2,2): 1 blue (bad)\n(2,3): 1 blue (bad)\n(3,3): 0 blue (good)\n\nSo, only 3 good pairs. That's worse than all red.\n\nOption 3: Color 1 blue, 2 red, 3 blue.\n\nIntervals:\n\n(1,1): 1 blue (bad)\n(1,2): 1 blue (bad)\n(1,3): 2 blues (good)\n(2,2): 0 blue (good)\n(2,3): 1 blue (bad)\n(3,3): 1 blue (bad)\n\nSo, 2 good pairs. Worse than all red.\n\nOption 4: Color 1 red, 2 red, 3 blue.\n\nIntervals:\n\n(1,1): 0 (good)\n(1,2): 0 (good)\n(1,3): 1 (bad)\n(2,2): 0 (good)\n(2,3): 1 (bad)\n(3,3): 1 (bad)\n\nSo, 3 good pairs. Still worse than all red.\n\nWait, so in n=2, coloring all red gives 6 good pairs, which is the maximum. So, maybe for n=2, the maximum is 6.\n\nBut wait, 2n-1=3, so n=2, 2n² -n= 8-2=6. So, all pairs are good if all are red.\n\nBut is that always the case? For n=1, all red gives 1 good pair, which is maximum. For n=2, all red gives 6, which is maximum.\n\nWait, but let's try n=3.\n\nn=3: numbers 1,2,3,4,5. Total pairs: 5+4+3+2+1=15.\n\nIf all red, all intervals have 0 blue, which is even. So, 15 good pairs.\n\nBut maybe there's a better coloring? Wait, 15 is the total number of pairs, so if all are red, all are good. So, maximum is 15.\n\nBut wait, maybe if we color some blue, we can have more? No, because if we color any blue, some intervals will have odd counts. So, all red gives maximum.\n\nWait, but maybe not. Let me test.\n\nSuppose n=3, color 1 red, 2 blue, 3 red, 4 blue, 5 red.\n\nSo, the coloring is R, B, R, B, R.\n\nNow, let's count the number of intervals with even blue counts.\n\nThis might take a while, but let's try.\n\nFirst, list all intervals:\n\nLength 1: (1,1): 0 (good)\n(2,2):1 (bad)\n(3,3):0 (good)\n(4,4):1 (bad)\n(5,5):0 (good)\nTotal so far: 3 good.\n\nLength 2:\n\n(1,2):1 (bad)\n(2,3):1 (bad)\n(3,4):1 (bad)\n(4,5):1 (bad)\nTotal: 0 good.\n\nLength 3:\n\n(1,3):1 (bad)\n(2,4):2 (good)\n(3,5):1 (bad)\nTotal:1 good.\n\nLength 4:\n\n(1,4):2 (good)\n(2,5):2 (good)\nTotal:2 good.\n\nLength 5:\n\n(1,5):2 (good)\nTotal:1 good.\n\nAdding up: 3 + 0 +1 +2 +1=7 good pairs. Which is much less than 15. So, all red is better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another coloring.\n\nWhat if we color all even numbers blue and odd red? Let's see.\n\nNumbers: R, B, R, B, R.\n\nWait, that's the same as above. So, same result.\n\nAlternatively, color all even red and odd blue.\n\nNumbers: B, R, B, R, B.\n\nLet's check intervals.\n\nLength 1:\n\n(1,1):1 (bad)\n(2,2):0 (good)\n(3,3):1 (bad)\n(4,4):0 (good)\n(5,5):1 (bad)\nTotal:2 good.\n\nLength 2:\n\n(1,2):1 (bad)\n(2,3):1 (bad)\n(3,4):1 (bad)\n(4,5):1 (bad)\nTotal:0.\n\nLength 3:\n\n(1,3):2 (good)\n(2,4):1 (bad)\n(3,5):2 (good)\nTotal:2.\n\nLength 4:\n\n(1,4):2 (good)\n(2,5):2 (good)\nTotal:2.\n\nLength 5:\n\n(1,5):3 (bad)\nTotal:0.\n\nTotal good pairs: 2+0+2+2+0=6. Still worse than all red.\n\nSo, seems like for n=3, all red gives 15 good pairs, which is maximum.\n\nWait, but maybe another coloring? What if we color some blues but in a way that more intervals have even counts.\n\nWait, but if we color any number blue, then the single-element interval containing that number will be bad. So, for each blue number, we lose at least one good pair. So, to maximize, we should minimize the number of blue numbers, but maybe strategically place them so that the loss is minimal.\n\nBut in the case of all red, we have all intervals good. So, that's the maximum.\n\nWait, but maybe for larger n, it's not possible to have all intervals good. Because as n increases, the number of intervals increases quadratically, but the number of single-element intervals is 2n-1, which is linear. So, if we color all red, all intervals are good, which is 2n² -n. But maybe for larger n, we can't have all intervals good because of overlapping intervals.\n\nWait, no, actually, if all numbers are red, then every interval has 0 blue numbers, which is even. So, all intervals are good. So, the maximum number of good pairs is 2n² -n.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"Wyznaczyć, w zależności od n, największą możliwą liczbę dobrych par, jaką Jadzia może uzyskać.\" So, is it always 2n² -n? But that seems too straightforward.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's written that Jadzia writes numbers from 1 to 2n-1. So, for n=1, 2n-1=1, n=2, 3, n=3,5, etc.\n\nBut in the examples above, for n=1,2,3, all red gives maximum good pairs. So, is the answer always 2n² -n?\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, the problem says \"liczby od 1 do 2n - 1 po kolei\". So, 2n-1 numbers. So, for n=1, 1 number; n=2, 3 numbers; n=3,5 numbers, etc.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it's written that Jadzia writes \"wszystkie liczby od 1 do 2n - 1 po kolei\", so she writes them in order, but each can be red or blue.\n\nWait, but if she writes all red, then all intervals have 0 blue numbers, which is even, so all intervals are good. So, the maximum number of good pairs is the total number of intervals, which is (2n-1)(2n)/2 = 2n² -n.\n\nBut maybe the problem is more complex because the definition of a good pair is that the number of blue numbers in [i,j] is even. So, if all are red, then yes, all are good. But perhaps the problem is more about the parity, and maybe there's a way to color such that more intervals have even counts, but I don't see how, because if you color any number blue, you immediately make some intervals bad.\n\nWait, but maybe if you color numbers in a way that the number of blue numbers in any interval is even, but that's impossible unless all are red, because any single blue number would make the interval [i,i] have 1 blue, which is odd.\n\nSo, the only way to have all intervals good is to have all numbers red. Therefore, the maximum number of good pairs is 2n² -n.\n\nBut wait, let me check for n=1: 2(1)^2 -1=1, which matches. For n=2: 8-2=6, which matches. For n=3: 18-3=15, which matches.\n\nSo, maybe the answer is 2n² -n.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"największą możliwą liczbę dobrych par\", so the maximum number of good pairs. So, if all red gives 2n² -n, which is the total number of pairs, then that's the maximum.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the definition is that the number of blue numbers is even, but not necessarily zero. So, if you have some blue numbers, you can have more intervals with even counts. But in reality, coloring some blue would make some intervals bad, but maybe more intervals good? Hmm, that seems counterintuitive.\n\nWait, let's think about it. If you color some numbers blue, then some intervals will have even counts, but others will have odd. So, it's a trade-off. Maybe the total number of good pairs can be higher than 2n² -n? But that can't be, because 2n² -n is the total number of pairs. So, if all are red, all are good. If you color any blue, you can't have more than that.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is that the definition is \"nieparzyste wiele\", which is \"an odd number\". Wait, no, the problem says \"nieparzyste wiele\" which is \"an odd number\". Wait, no, the problem says \"nieparzyste wiele\" which is \"an odd number\". Wait, no, the problem says \"nieparzyste wiele\" which is \"an odd number\". Wait, no, the problem says \"nieparzyste wiele\" which is \"an odd number\".

Hmm, that sounds pretty interesting. Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, let me understand the question properly. We're looking for a number \\( 2^k \\) where each digit 0 through 9 occurs exactly the same number of times. So, for example, if \\( 2^k \\) has 10 digits, each digit should appear once. If it has 20 digits, each should appear twice, and so on. So, the total number of digits in \\( 2^k \\) must be a multiple of 10 because we have 10 different digits, each needing to appear the same number of times.\n\nLet me think about how many digits \\( 2^k \\) has. The number of digits \\( d \\) in a number \\( n \\) in base 10 is given by \\( d = \\lfloor \\log_{10} n \\rfloor + 1 \\). So, for \\( 2^k \\), the number of digits is \\( \\lfloor k \\log_{10} 2 \\rfloor + 1 \\). Since \\( \\log_{10} 2 \\) is approximately 0.3010, the number of digits grows roughly linearly with \\( k \\).\n\nSo, if we want the number of digits to be a multiple of 10, say \\( 10m \\) digits, then \\( \\lfloor k \\times 0.3010 \\rfloor + 1 = 10m \\). That means \\( k \\times 0.3010 \\) is approximately \\( 10m - 1 \\). So, \\( k \\approx \\frac{10m - 1}{0.3010} \\). Let me compute that for some \\( m \\).\n\nFor \\( m = 1 \\), \\( k \\approx \\frac{9}{0.3010} \\approx 29.9 \\). So, around 30. Let me check \\( 2^{30} \\). \\( 2^{10} = 1024, 2^{20} = 1,048,576, 2^{30} = 1,073,741,824 \\). That's 10 digits. Let me count the digits: 1,0,7,3,7,4,1,8,2,4. So, digits are: 0:1, 1:2, 2:1, 3:1, 4:2, 7:2, 8:1. Others like 5,6,9 are missing. So, definitely not all digits present equally.\n\nWait, but for \\( m = 1 \\), we need 10 digits, each appearing once. But \\( 2^{30} \\) is 10 digits, but as I saw, not all digits are present. So, maybe \\( m = 2 \\), which would require 20 digits. Let's see what \\( k \\) would be. \\( k \\approx \\frac{19}{0.3010} \\approx 63.1 \\). So, around 63. Let me check \\( 2^{63} \\). I don't remember the exact value, but I can compute it or look it up.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the properties of \\( 2^k \\). The digits of \\( 2^k \\) are known to be somewhat random, but they don't necessarily have uniform distribution. In fact, Benford's Law suggests that the leading digits are not uniform, but trailing digits might be more uniform. However, for all digits to be exactly the same count, that's a much stricter condition.\n\nI recall that such numbers are called \"digitally delicate\" or something similar, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's related to pandigital numbers, but pandigital usually means containing each digit at least once, not necessarily the same number of times.\n\nWait, actually, a number where each digit from 0 to 9 appears the same number of times is called a \"polydivisible\" number? Or maybe not. Maybe it's just a specific type of number. Anyway, regardless of the name, the question is whether such a \\( k \\) exists.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the length of \\( 2^k \\). For the digits to be equally distributed, the number of digits must be a multiple of 10, say \\( 10m \\). So, \\( 2^k \\) must have \\( 10m \\) digits. So, \\( 10^{10m - 1} \\leq 2^k < 10^{10m} \\). Taking logarithms, \\( (10m - 1) \\leq k \\log_{10} 2 < 10m \\). So, \\( k \\) must satisfy \\( \\frac{10m - 1}{\\log_{10} 2} \\leq k < \\frac{10m}{\\log_{10} 2} \\).\n\nGiven that \\( \\log_{10} 2 \\approx 0.3010 \\), so \\( k \\) is approximately \\( \\frac{10m}{0.3010} \\approx 33.22m \\). So, for each \\( m \\), we can compute the range of \\( k \\) and check if any \\( 2^k \\) in that range has equal digit counts.\n\nBut checking each \\( k \\) manually is impractical. Maybe there's a mathematical reason why such a \\( k \\) can't exist.\n\nWait, another thought: The sum of the digits of \\( 2^k \\) modulo 9 is equal to \\( 2^k \\mod 9 \\). Since \\( 2^k \\) cycles modulo 9. Let's compute \\( 2^k \\mod 9 \\). The cycle is 2,4,8,7,5,1,2,4,... so period 6.\n\nIf each digit from 0 to 9 appears \\( m \\) times, the sum of digits is \\( m \\times (0+1+2+...+9) = 45m \\). So, the sum of digits is \\( 45m \\), which is divisible by 9. Therefore, \\( 2^k \\equiv 0 \\mod 9 \\). But \\( 2^k \\mod 9 \\) cycles through 2,4,8,7,5,1. So, it never is 0 modulo 9. Therefore, the sum of digits can't be divisible by 9, which is a contradiction because \\( 45m \\) is divisible by 9.\n\nWait, that seems like a solid argument. So, if such a \\( k \\) exists, the sum of digits of \\( 2^k \\) must be \\( 45m \\), which is divisible by 9. But \\( 2^k \\mod 9 \\) is never 0, so the sum of digits can't be divisible by 9. Therefore, such a \\( k \\) cannot exist.\n\nWait, let me verify that. The sum of the digits of a number is congruent to the number modulo 9. So, if the sum of digits is \\( 45m \\), which is 0 mod 9, then \\( 2^k \\equiv 0 \\mod 9 \\). But \\( 2^k \\) modulo 9 cycles as I said: 2,4,8,7,5,1,2,4,... So, it never hits 0. Therefore, it's impossible for the sum of digits to be divisible by 9, which is required for each digit to appear equally. Therefore, such a \\( k \\) cannot exist.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that no such positive integer \\( k \\) exists.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{NIE}\n</think>\n\nTo determine if there exists a positive integer \\( k \\) such that the decimal representation of \\( 2^k \\) contains each digit from 0 to 9 the same number of times, we need to consider the properties of the digits of \\( 2^k \\).\n\n1. **Number of Digits**: The number of digits \\( d \\) in \\( 2^k \\) is given by \\( d = \\lfloor k \\log_{10} 2 \\rfloor + 1 \\). For each digit from 0 to 9 to appear the same number of times, the total number of digits must be a multiple of 10, say \\( 10m \\).\n\n2. **Sum of Digits**: If each digit from 0 to 9 appears \\( m \\) times, the sum of the digits is \\( 45m \\), which is divisible by 9. Therefore, the sum of the digits of \\( 2^k \\) must be divisible by 9.\n\n3. **Modulo 9 Consideration**: The sum of the digits of a number is congruent to the number modulo 9. Thus, \\( 2^k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{9} \\). However, \\( 2^k \\mod 9 \\) cycles through 2, 4, 8, 7, 5, 1, and never hits 0. This means \\( 2^k \\) can never be congruent to 0 modulo 9.\n\nSince the sum of the digits of \\( 2^k \\) cannot be divisible by 9, it is impossible for each digit from 0 to 9 to appear the same number of times in the decimal representation of \\( 2^k \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{NIE}\n\\]", "answer": "Taka liczba **nie** istnieje.  \nZałóżmy, że taka liczba całkowita \\( k \\) istnieje i niech \\( \\ell \\) będzie liczbą wystąpień każdej z cyfr \\( 0, 1, \\ldots, 9 \\) w zapisie dziesiętnym liczby \\( 2^k \\).

Also, it's given that \\( a_4 = a_1 \\) and \\( b_4 = b_1 \\). Hmm, that seems a bit cyclic, so maybe there's some kind of repeating pattern or system of equations here.\n\nLet me try to break it down step by step. For each \\( i \\), the quadratic equation \\( x^2 + a_i x + b_i = 0 \\) has two distinct roots, which are \\( a_{i+1} \\) and \\( b_{i+1} \\). Since these are roots, by Vieta's formulas, I can write the following relationships:\n\n1. The sum of the roots \\( a_{i+1} + b_{i+1} = -a_i \\).\n2. The product of the roots \\( a_{i+1} \\cdot b_{i+1} = b_i \\).\n\nSo, for each \\( i \\), we have these two equations. Let me write them out for each \\( i \\):\n\nFor \\( i = 1 \\):\n- \\( a_2 + b_2 = -a_1 \\)  (Equation 1)\n- \\( a_2 b_2 = b_1 \\)      (Equation 2)\n\nFor \\( i = 2 \\):\n- \\( a_3 + b_3 = -a_2 \\)  (Equation 3)\n- \\( a_3 b_3 = b_2 \\)      (Equation 4)\n\nFor \\( i = 3 \\):\n- \\( a_4 + b_4 = -a_3 \\)  (Equation 5)\n- \\( a_4 b_4 = b_3 \\)      (Equation 6)\n\nBut since \\( a_4 = a_1 \\) and \\( b_4 = b_1 \\), Equation 5 becomes:\n- \\( a_1 + b_1 = -a_3 \\)  (Equation 5a)\nAnd Equation 6 becomes:\n- \\( a_1 b_1 = b_3 \\)      (Equation 6a)\n\nSo now, I have six equations:\n\n1. \\( a_2 + b_2 = -a_1 \\)\n2. \\( a_2 b_2 = b_1 \\)\n3. \\( a_3 + b_3 = -a_2 \\)\n4. \\( a_3 b_3 = b_2 \\)\n5. \\( a_1 + b_1 = -a_3 \\)\n6. \\( a_1 b_1 = b_3 \\)\n\nHmm, so this is a system of six equations with six variables: \\( a_1, a_2, a_3, b_1, b_2, b_3 \\). Maybe I can express each variable in terms of the previous ones and find a pattern or a cycle.\n\nLet me try to express each \\( b_i \\) in terms of \\( a_i \\) and the next \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). From Equation 1: \\( b_2 = -a_1 - a_2 \\). From Equation 2: \\( b_1 = a_2 b_2 \\). Substituting \\( b_2 \\) from Equation 1 into Equation 2: \\( b_1 = a_2 (-a_1 - a_2) = -a_1 a_2 - a_2^2 \\).\n\nSimilarly, from Equation 3: \\( b_3 = -a_2 - a_3 \\). From Equation 4: \\( b_2 = a_3 b_3 \\). Substituting \\( b_3 \\) from Equation 3 into Equation 4: \\( b_2 = a_3 (-a_2 - a_3) = -a_2 a_3 - a_3^2 \\).\n\nBut from Equation 1, \\( b_2 = -a_1 - a_2 \\). So, equating the two expressions for \\( b_2 \\):\n\n\\( -a_1 - a_2 = -a_2 a_3 - a_3^2 \\)\n\nSimplify this:\n\n\\( -a_1 - a_2 = -a_2 a_3 - a_3^2 \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n\\( a_1 + a_2 = a_2 a_3 + a_3^2 \\)\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n\\( a_1 = a_2 a_3 + a_3^2 - a_2 \\)  (Equation 7)\n\nNow, moving on to Equation 5a: \\( a_1 + b_1 = -a_3 \\). From Equation 2, \\( b_1 = -a_1 a_2 - a_2^2 \\). So substituting into Equation 5a:\n\n\\( a_1 + (-a_1 a_2 - a_2^2) = -a_3 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( a_1 - a_1 a_2 - a_2^2 = -a_3 \\)\n\nFactor \\( a_1 \\):\n\n\\( a_1 (1 - a_2) - a_2^2 = -a_3 \\)\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n\\( a_3 = -a_1 (1 - a_2) + a_2^2 \\)  (Equation 8)\n\nNow, from Equation 6a: \\( a_1 b_1 = b_3 \\). From Equation 4, \\( b_3 = -a_2 - a_3 \\). So:\n\n\\( a_1 b_1 = -a_2 - a_3 \\)\n\nBut from Equation 2, \\( b_1 = -a_1 a_2 - a_2^2 \\). So:\n\n\\( a_1 (-a_1 a_2 - a_2^2) = -a_2 - a_3 \\)\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\n\\( -a_1^2 a_2 - a_1 a_2^2 = -a_2 - a_3 \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n\\( a_1^2 a_2 + a_1 a_2^2 = a_2 + a_3 \\)\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n\\( a_3 = a_1^2 a_2 + a_1 a_2^2 - a_2 \\)  (Equation 9)\n\nNow, from Equation 8 and Equation 9, both express \\( a_3 \\) in terms of \\( a_1 \\) and \\( a_2 \\). So, let's set them equal:\n\nFrom Equation 8: \\( a_3 = -a_1 (1 - a_2) + a_2^2 \\)\n\nFrom Equation 9: \\( a_3 = a_1^2 a_2 + a_1 a_2^2 - a_2 \\)\n\nSo:\n\n\\( -a_1 (1 - a_2) + a_2^2 = a_1^2 a_2 + a_1 a_2^2 - a_2 \\)\n\nLet me expand the left side:\n\n\\( -a_1 + a_1 a_2 + a_2^2 = a_1^2 a_2 + a_1 a_2^2 - a_2 \\)\n\nBring all terms to the left side:\n\n\\( -a_1 + a_1 a_2 + a_2^2 - a_1^2 a_2 - a_1 a_2^2 + a_2 = 0 \\)\n\nLet me group like terms:\n\n- Terms with \\( a_1^2 a_2 \\): \\( -a_1^2 a_2 \\)\n- Terms with \\( a_1 a_2^2 \\): \\( -a_1 a_2^2 \\)\n- Terms with \\( a_1 a_2 \\): \\( a_1 a_2 \\)\n- Terms with \\( a_1 \\): \\( -a_1 \\)\n- Terms with \\( a_2^2 \\): \\( a_2^2 \\)\n- Terms with \\( a_2 \\): \\( a_2 \\)\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\( -a_1^2 a_2 - a_1 a_2^2 + a_1 a_2 - a_1 + a_2^2 + a_2 = 0 \\)\n\nHmm, this looks complicated. Maybe factor out some terms.\n\nLet me factor \\( a_1 \\) from the first three terms:\n\n\\( a_1 (-a_1 a_2 - a_2^2 + a_2) - a_1 + a_2^2 + a_2 = 0 \\)\n\nWait, that might not help much. Alternatively, maybe factor \\( a_2 \\) from some terms.\n\nLooking again:\n\n\\( -a_1^2 a_2 - a_1 a_2^2 + a_1 a_2 - a_1 + a_2^2 + a_2 = 0 \\)\n\nLet me factor \\( a_2 \\) from the first three terms:\n\n\\( a_2 (-a_1^2 - a_1 a_2 + a_1) - a_1 + a_2^2 + a_2 = 0 \\)\n\nHmm, not sure. Maybe rearrange terms:\n\nGroup terms with \\( a_1^2 a_2 \\), \\( a_1 a_2^2 \\), \\( a_1 a_2 \\), \\( a_1 \\), \\( a_2^2 \\), \\( a_2 \\):\n\n- \\( -a_1^2 a_2 \\)\n- \\( -a_1 a_2^2 \\)\n- \\( +a_1 a_2 \\)\n- \\( -a_1 \\)\n- \\( +a_2^2 \\)\n- \\( +a_2 \\)\n\nMaybe factor \\( a_1 \\) from the first four terms:\n\n\\( a_1 (-a_1 a_2 - a_2^2 + a_2 - 1) + a_2^2 + a_2 = 0 \\)\n\nSo:\n\n\\( a_1 (-a_1 a_2 - a_2^2 + a_2 - 1) + a_2 (a_2 + 1) = 0 \\)\n\nThis still seems complicated. Maybe I can factor further or find a substitution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that all \\( a_i \\) are equal? Let me test that.\n\nSuppose \\( a_1 = a_2 = a_3 = a \\) and \\( b_1 = b_2 = b_3 = b \\). Then, let's see if this satisfies the equations.\n\nFrom Equation 1: \\( a + b = -a \\) => \\( 2a + b = 0 \\)\nFrom Equation 2: \\( a b = b \\) => If \\( b \\neq 0 \\), then \\( a = 1 \\). If \\( b = 0 \\), then from Equation 1: \\( 2a = 0 \\) => \\( a = 0 \\).\n\nCase 1: \\( b = 0 \\). Then from Equation 1: \\( 2a = 0 \\) => \\( a = 0 \\). So all \\( a_i = 0 \\) and \\( b_i = 0 \\). Let's check if this works.\n\nFor each equation \\( x^2 + 0x + 0 = x^2 = 0 \\), which has a double root at 0. But the problem states that \\( a_{i+1} \\) and \\( b_{i+1} \\) are distinct roots. So this case is invalid because the roots are not distinct. So \\( b \\) cannot be zero.\n\nCase 2: \\( b \\neq 0 \\). Then from Equation 2: \\( a = 1 \\). From Equation 1: \\( 2(1) + b = 0 \\) => \\( b = -2 \\).\n\nSo, \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -2 \\). Let's check if this works for all equations.\n\nFrom Equation 3: \\( a + b = -a \\) => \\( 1 + (-2) = -1 \\) => \\( -1 = -1 \\) ✔️\n\nFrom Equation 4: \\( a b = b \\) => \\( 1*(-2) = -2 \\) ✔️\n\nFrom Equation 5a: \\( a + b = -a \\) => same as above ✔️\n\nFrom Equation 6a: \\( a b = b \\) => same as above ✔️\n\nSo, this seems consistent. So, if all \\( a_i = 1 \\) and all \\( b_i = -2 \\), then the conditions are satisfied. But wait, let's check if the roots are distinct.\n\nFor each equation \\( x^2 + x - 2 = 0 \\), the roots are \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( x = -2 \\). So, \\( a_{i+1} \\) and \\( b_{i+1} \\) are 1 and -2, which are distinct. So this works.\n\nBut is this the only solution? Maybe not. Let's see if there are other possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sequence cycles through different values. Let me consider that \\( a_1, a_2, a_3 \\) are not all equal.\n\nLet me try to express everything in terms of \\( a_1 \\) and \\( a_2 \\). From Equation 7: \\( a_1 = a_2 a_3 + a_3^2 - a_2 \\). From Equation 8: \\( a_3 = -a_1 (1 - a_2) + a_2^2 \\). So, substitute Equation 8 into Equation 7.\n\nSo, \\( a_1 = a_2 [ -a_1 (1 - a_2) + a_2^2 ] + [ -a_1 (1 - a_2) + a_2^2 ]^2 - a_2 \\)\n\nThis looks messy, but let's try to expand it step by step.\n\nFirst, compute \\( a_2 [ -a_1 (1 - a_2) + a_2^2 ] \\):\n\n= \\( -a_1 a_2 (1 - a_2) + a_2^3 \\)\n\n= \\( -a_1 a_2 + a_1 a_2^2 + a_2^3 \\)\n\nNext, compute \\( [ -a_1 (1 - a_2) + a_2^2 ]^2 \\):\n\nLet me denote \\( C = -", "answer": "Korzystając ze wzorów Viete’a warunki dane w zadaniu można zapisać jako układ równań\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases} \na_1 + b_1 = -a_3 \\\\ \na_2 + b_2 = -a_1 \\\\ \na_3 + b_3 = -a_2 \\\\ \na_1 b_1 = b_3 \\\\ \na_2 b_2 = b_1 \\\\ \na_3 b_3 = b_2 \n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nPrzypuśćmy, że któraś z liczb \\(b_1, b_2, b_3\\) jest równa \\(0\\).

Let me start by considering small values of \\( n \\) and see if I can find a pattern or maybe even a general rule.\n\nLet's start with \\( n = 1 \\). That's the simplest case. The grid is just a single cell. I need to put a square number in it, say \\( k^2 \\). The sum of the row (which is just that single number) must be a square, which it is, and the sum of the column (also that single number) must be a square, which it is. Since there's only one row and one column, the sums are trivially distinct because there's only one of each. So, \\( n = 1 \\) works.\n\nMoving on to \\( n = 2 \\). Now, I have a 2x2 grid. I need to fill it with four distinct square numbers. Let me denote the grid as:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|}\n\\hline\na^2 & b^2 \\\\\n\\hline\nc^2 & d^2 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nEach of \\( a^2, b^2, c^2, d^2 \\) must be distinct. Then, the row sums are \\( a^2 + b^2 \\) and \\( c^2 + d^2 \\), and the column sums are \\( a^2 + c^2 \\) and \\( b^2 + d^2 \\). All four of these sums must be perfect squares and distinct.\n\nSo, I need to find four distinct squares such that when I add them in pairs (rows and columns), I get four distinct perfect squares. Let me try to find such numbers.\n\nLet me list some small squares: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, etc.\n\nI need four distinct squares. Let me try the smallest ones first: 1, 4, 9, 16.\n\nLet me assign them to the grid:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|}\n\\hline\n1 & 4 \\\\\n\\hline\n9 & 16 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's compute the row sums: 1 + 4 = 5, which is not a square. 9 + 16 = 25, which is a square. Column sums: 1 + 9 = 10, not a square; 4 + 16 = 20, not a square. So, that doesn't work.\n\nLet me try a different arrangement. Maybe 1, 9, 16, 25.\n\nAssigning:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|}\n\\hline\n1 & 25 \\\\\n\\hline\n16 & 9 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nRow sums: 1 + 25 = 26 (not square), 16 + 9 = 25 (square). Column sums: 1 + 16 = 17 (not square), 25 + 9 = 34 (not square). Still not good.\n\nMaybe try 4, 9, 16, 25.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|}\n\\hline\n4 & 9 \\\\\n\\hline\n16 & 25 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nRow sums: 4 + 9 = 13 (not square), 16 + 25 = 41 (not square). Column sums: 4 + 16 = 20 (not square), 9 + 25 = 34 (not square). Nope.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to use larger squares. Let me try 1, 16, 25, 36.\n\nAssigning:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|}\n\\hline\n1 & 36 \\\\\n\\hline\n25 & 16 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nRow sums: 1 + 36 = 37 (not square), 25 + 16 = 41 (not square). Column sums: 1 + 25 = 26 (not square), 36 + 16 = 52 (not square). Still no luck.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps the row sums and column sums can be different squares, but maybe not necessarily the next ones. Let me see if I can find four squares where their pairwise sums are also squares.\n\nI remember that Pythagorean triples can help here because they involve sums of squares being squares. For example, 3-4-5: 9 + 16 = 25. So, if I have 9 and 16 in a row, their sum is 25, which is a square. Similarly, maybe another pair.\n\nLet me try:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|}\n\\hline\n9 & 16 \\\\\n\\hline\n16 & 9 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nBut wait, the squares must be distinct. So, I can't have two 9s or two 16s. So, that won't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 1, 25, 16, 9.\n\nWait, let me try:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|}\n\\hline\n1 & 25 \\\\\n\\hline\n16 & 9 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nRow sums: 1 + 25 = 26 (not square), 16 + 9 = 25 (square). Column sums: 1 + 16 = 17 (not square), 25 + 9 = 34 (not square). Still not good.\n\nWait, maybe I need to use different squares. Let me think of another Pythagorean triple. 5-12-13: 25 + 144 = 169. But 144 is quite large. Maybe that's too big for a 2x2 grid.\n\nAlternatively, 7-24-25: 49 + 576 = 625. That's even bigger. Maybe not useful here.\n\nWait, maybe I can use 0 as a square? But 0 is a square, but the problem says \"liczby całkowite\", which is integers, so 0 is allowed. But the squares would be 0, 1, 4, 9, etc. But the problem says \"parami różne kwadraty liczb całkowitych\", so distinct squares. So, 0 is allowed, but I need to check if that helps.\n\nLet me try:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|}\n\\hline\n0 & 1 \\\\\n\\hline\n4 & 9 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nRow sums: 0 + 1 = 1 (square), 4 + 9 = 13 (not square). Column sums: 0 + 4 = 4 (square), 1 + 9 = 10 (not square). So, only two sums are squares, not all four.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|}\n\\hline\n0 & 4 \\\\\n\\hline\n1 & 9 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nRow sums: 0 + 4 = 4 (square), 1 + 9 = 10 (not square). Column sums: 0 + 1 = 1 (square), 4 + 9 = 13 (not square). Still not all four.\n\nHmm, maybe 0 isn't helping. Let me try without 0.\n\nWait, maybe I need to use larger squares. Let me try 16, 25, 36, 49.\n\nAssigning:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|}\n\\hline\n16 & 25 \\\\\n\\hline\n36 & 49 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nRow sums: 16 + 25 = 41 (not square), 36 + 49 = 85 (not square). Column sums: 16 + 36 = 52 (not square), 25 + 49 = 74 (not square). Nope.\n\nWait, maybe I need to arrange them differently. Let me try:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|}\n\\hline\n16 & 49 \\\\\n\\hline\n25 & 36 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nRow sums: 16 + 49 = 65 (not square), 25 + 36 = 61 (not square). Column sums: 16 + 25 = 41 (not square), 49 + 36 = 85 (not square). Still no.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the properties required.\n\nEach row sum and column sum must be a square, and all must be distinct. So, for \\( n = 2 \\), I need four distinct squares for the grid, and four distinct squares for the row and column sums, making a total of eight distinct squares? Wait, no, the grid has four squares, and the row and column sums are four more, but they can overlap with the grid squares? Or are they separate?\n\nWait, the problem says \"wpisać parami różne kwadraty liczb całkowitych\", so the numbers in the grid are distinct squares. The sums are also squares, but they don't necessarily have to be distinct from the grid numbers, just the 2n sums must be distinct among themselves.\n\nWait, let me check the original problem statement: \"suma liczb w każdym wierszu i w każdej kolumnie tablicy była kwadratem liczby całkowitej oraz te \\( 2n \\) sum było parami różnych.\"\n\nSo, it says that the sums in each row and column are squares, and those \\( 2n \\) sums are pairwise different. So, the sums must be distinct, but they can overlap with the grid numbers? Or not necessarily. Wait, the grid numbers are squares, and the sums are squares, but the sums don't have to be distinct from the grid numbers, just the sums themselves must be distinct.\n\nSo, for \\( n = 2 \\), I need four distinct squares in the grid, and four distinct squares as sums (two row sums, two column sums), and all four sums must be different from each other.\n\nSo, maybe the sums can include some of the grid numbers, but they have to be different from each other.\n\nWait, but in the grid, the numbers are already squares, so if a sum equals one of them, that's allowed as long as the sums are distinct.\n\nBut in the case of \\( n = 2 \\), let's see if it's possible.\n\nLet me try to find four distinct squares such that their row sums and column sums are also squares, and all four sums are distinct.\n\nLet me think of a known example. I remember that 3² + 4² = 5², which is 9 + 16 = 25. So, if I have a row with 9 and 16, the sum is 25. Similarly, maybe another row with different squares.\n\nBut then, the columns would have to sum to squares as well. Let me try:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|}\n\\hline\n9 & 16 \\\\\n\\hline\n16 & 9 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nBut wait, the grid numbers must be distinct. So, I can't have two 9s or two 16s. So, that won't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|}\n\\hline\n9 & 16 \\\\\n\\hline\n25 & 0 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nRow sums: 25 and 25. But they have to be distinct. So, that's no good.\n\nWait, maybe:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|}\n\\hline\n1 & 24 \\\\\n\\hline\n24 & 1 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nBut 24 isn't a square. So, that's not allowed.\n\nWait, maybe I need to use larger squares. Let me think of 25, 144, 169, etc.\n\nWait, 25 + 144 = 169, which is 13². So, if I have a row with 25 and 144, the sum is 169. Similarly, another row with different squares.\n\nBut then, the columns would have to sum to squares as well. Let me try:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|}\n\\hline\n25 & 144 \\\\\n\\hline\n169 & x \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nWait, but 169 is already a square, so x would have to be another square. Let me see, the column sums would be 25 + 169 = 194 (not a square) and 144 + x. Hmm, 144 + x needs to be a square. Let me see, 144 + x = y². So, x = y² - 144. Let me pick y such that y² > ", "answer": "Wszystkie \\(n > 2\\).  \nOczywiście dla \\(n = 1\\) sumy w jednym wierszu i w jednej kolumnie są takie same.

Hmm, let me make sure I understand it correctly. It says the square root of the product of x and y is equal to the sum of the square roots of x and y, each added twice. So, simplifying the right side, that would be 2√x + 2√y. So, the equation becomes √(xy) = 2√x + 2√y.\n\nAlright, so I need to find all pairs of non-negative integers x and y that satisfy this equation. Non-negative integers mean x and y can be 0, 1, 2, and so on. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, maybe I can square both sides to eliminate the square roots. That often helps in equations involving square roots. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with √(xy) = 2√x + 2√y.\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n(√(xy))² = (2√x + 2√y)²\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nxy = (2√x + 2√y)²\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n(2√x + 2√y)² = (2√x)² + 2*(2√x)*(2√y) + (2√y)²\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n(2√x)² = 4x\n\n(2√y)² = 4y\n\nThe middle term: 2*(2√x)*(2√y) = 8√(xy)\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nxy = 4x + 4y + 8√(xy)\n\nHmm, okay. So now I have:\n\nxy = 4x + 4y + 8√(xy)\n\nThis still has a square root in it, which complicates things. Maybe I can rearrange the equation to isolate the square root term.\n\nLet me subtract 4x and 4y from both sides:\n\nxy - 4x - 4y = 8√(xy)\n\nHmm, that looks a bit better. Let me denote √(xy) as z for simplicity. So, z = √(xy). Then, z² = xy.\n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\nz² - 4x - 4y = 8z\n\nBut wait, z is √(xy), so maybe I can express x and y in terms of z? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can factor the left side.\n\nLooking at the left side: xy - 4x - 4y. Maybe I can factor this expression.\n\nLet me try adding 16 to both sides to complete the square. Let's see:\n\nxy - 4x - 4y + 16 = 8z + 16\n\nWait, why 16? Because if I have xy -4x -4y, adding 16 would make it (x - 4)(y - 4). Let me check:\n\n(x - 4)(y - 4) = xy -4x -4y +16. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, (x - 4)(y - 4) = 8z + 16\n\nBut z is √(xy), so:\n\n(x - 4)(y - 4) = 8√(xy) + 16\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I can let u = √x and v = √y. Since x and y are non-negative integers, u and v will be non-negative real numbers, but since x and y are integers, u and v will be either integers or irrationals. But since we're dealing with square roots, maybe u and v are integers? Wait, not necessarily, unless x and y are perfect squares.\n\nBut let's try substituting u and v. Let u = √x and v = √y. Then, x = u² and y = v². So, the original equation becomes:\n\n√(u² * v²) = 2u + 2v\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\n√(u²v²) = uv\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\nuv = 2u + 2v\n\nThat's simpler! So, uv = 2u + 2v.\n\nLet me rearrange this:\n\nuv - 2u - 2v = 0\n\nHmm, maybe I can factor this. Let's add 4 to both sides:\n\nuv - 2u - 2v + 4 = 4\n\nNow, factor the left side:\n\n(u - 2)(v - 2) = 4\n\nAh, that's much better! So, (u - 2)(v - 2) = 4.\n\nNow, since u and v are non-negative real numbers, and x and y are non-negative integers, u and v must be non-negative integers as well because x and y are perfect squares (since u = √x and v = √y must be integers for x and y to be integers). Wait, is that necessarily true? Let me think.\n\nIf x is a non-negative integer, then √x is either an integer or irrational. But since u and v are used in the equation (u - 2)(v - 2) = 4, which is an integer, and 4 is an integer, then (u - 2) and (v - 2) must be integers because their product is 4. Therefore, u and v must be integers because if (u - 2) is an integer, then u is an integer plus 2, so u is an integer. Similarly for v.\n\nTherefore, u and v are integers, and x = u², y = v².\n\nSo, now, we have (u - 2)(v - 2) = 4, where u and v are integers greater than or equal to 0.\n\nBut since u and v are non-negative integers, (u - 2) and (v - 2) must be integers as well. Let me denote a = u - 2 and b = v - 2. Then, a * b = 4, and a and b are integers. Also, since u and v are non-negative, a and b must satisfy:\n\nu = a + 2 ≥ 0 ⇒ a ≥ -2\n\nv = b + 2 ≥ 0 ⇒ b ≥ -2\n\nSo, a and b are integers greater than or equal to -2, and their product is 4.\n\nNow, let's list all pairs of integers (a, b) such that a * b = 4 and a, b ≥ -2.\n\nThe integer pairs (a, b) that multiply to 4 are:\n\n(1, 4), (2, 2), (4, 1), (-1, -4), (-2, -2), (-4, -1)\n\nBut we have the constraints that a ≥ -2 and b ≥ -2. So, let's check each pair:\n\n1. (1, 4): a=1, b=4. Both are ≥ -2. Okay.\n2. (2, 2): a=2, b=2. Okay.\n3. (4, 1): a=4, b=1. Okay.\n4. (-1, -4): a=-1, b=-4. But b=-4 < -2. Not allowed.\n5. (-2, -2): a=-2, b=-2. Both are ≥ -2. Okay.\n6. (-4, -1): a=-4 < -2, b=-1. Not allowed.\n\nSo, the valid pairs are (1,4), (2,2), (4,1), (-2,-2).\n\nNow, let's find u and v for each pair:\n\n1. For (a, b) = (1,4):\n   u = a + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3\n   v = b + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6\n   So, x = u² = 9, y = v² = 36\n\n2. For (a, b) = (2,2):\n   u = 2 + 2 = 4\n   v = 2 + 2 = 4\n   So, x = 16, y = 16\n\n3. For (a, b) = (4,1):\n   u = 4 + 2 = 6\n   v = 1 + 2 = 3\n   So, x = 36, y = 9\n\n4. For (a, b) = (-2,-2):\n   u = -2 + 2 = 0\n   v = -2 + 2 = 0\n   So, x = 0² = 0, y = 0² = 0\n\nSo, the possible pairs (x, y) are (9, 36), (16, 16), (36, 9), and (0, 0).\n\nBut wait, let's check if these solutions satisfy the original equation.\n\nFirst, (0, 0):\n\n√(0*0) = √0 + √0 + √0 + √0 ⇒ 0 = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 ⇒ 0=0. True.\n\nNext, (9, 36):\n\n√(9*36) = √9 + √36 + √9 + √36\n\n√324 = 3 + 6 + 3 + 6\n\n18 = 3 + 6 + 3 + 6 ⇒ 18 = 18. True.\n\nSimilarly, (36, 9):\n\nSame as above, since multiplication is commutative. √(36*9) = √36 + √9 + √36 + √9 ⇒ 18 = 6 + 3 + 6 + 3 ⇒ 18=18. True.\n\nNow, (16,16):\n\n√(16*16) = √16 + √16 + √16 + √16\n\n√256 = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4\n\n16 = 16. True.\n\nSo, all these solutions work.\n\nWait, but are there any other possible pairs? Let me think. We considered all factor pairs of 4 where a and b are integers ≥ -2. So, I think we have all possible solutions.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if there are any other factor pairs of 4 with a and b ≥ -2.\n\nWe considered (1,4), (2,2), (4,1), (-2,-2). Are there any others?\n\nWell, 4 can also be factored as (-1)*(-4), but as we saw earlier, that would lead to b=-4, which is less than -2, so it's invalid. Similarly, (-4)*(-1) is invalid. So, no other pairs.\n\nTherefore, the solutions are (0,0), (9,36), (16,16), and (36,9).\n\nWait, but the problem says \"pary nieujemnych liczb całkowitych\", which translates to \"pairs of non-negative integers\". So, 0 is allowed, as we have (0,0). So, all these are valid.\n\nIs there a possibility that u or v could be negative? Well, since u = √x and v = √y, and x and y are non-negative, u and v must be non-negative as well. So, u and v can't be negative, which is why a and b can't be less than -2, because u = a + 2 and v = b + 2 must be non-negative.\n\nTherefore, I think we have all possible solutions.\n\nSo, the pairs are (0,0), (9,36), (16,16), and (36,9).\n\nWait, but let me check if (0,0) is the only solution where x or y is zero. Suppose x=0, then the original equation becomes √0 = √0 + √y + √0 + √y ⇒ 0 = 0 + √y + 0 + √y ⇒ 0 = 2√y. So, √y=0 ⇒ y=0. So, the only solution with x=0 is y=0, which we already have.\n\nSimilarly, if y=0, then x must be 0. So, no other solutions with x or y zero except (0,0).\n\nTherefore, the complete set of solutions is (0,0), (9,36), (16,16), and (36,9).\n\nI think that's all. Let me just recap:\n\nWe started with √(xy) = 2√x + 2√y.\n\nSubstituted u=√x, v=√y, leading to uv = 2u + 2v.\n\nRearranged to (u-2)(v-2)=4.\n\nFound all integer pairs (a,b) where a*b=4 and a,b ≥ -2, leading to u and v, then x and y.\n\nChecked all solutions in the original equation, and they worked.\n\nSo, the final answer should be these four pairs.\n</think>\n\nThe pairs of non-negative integers \\( x, y \\) that satisfy the equation are \\( (0, 0) \\), \\( (9, 36) \\), \\( (16, 16) \\), and \\( (36, 9) \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(0, 0)}, \\boxed{(9, 36)}, \\boxed{(16, 16)}, \\boxed{(36, 9)}\n\\]", "answer": "Jedynymi parami nieujemnych liczb całkowitych \\( x, y \\) spełniającymi dane równanie są: \\( (0, 0), (9, 16) \\) i \\( (16, 9) \\)."}

Maybe there's some symmetry here that I can exploit. Let me see.\n\nFirst, I notice that each equation has a similar structure: a term with a squared variable multiplied by another variable, plus 2, equals the variable itself plus twice the product of the other two variables. So, for example, the first equation is \\(x^2y + 2 = x + 2yz\\). The other two follow the same pattern with y and z.\n\nSince the equations are symmetric, maybe the solutions are symmetric as well. That is, maybe \\(x = y = z\\). Let me test that idea.\n\nAssume \\(x = y = z = k\\), where k is some real number. Then, substituting into the first equation:\n\n\\(k^2 \\cdot k + 2 = k + 2 \\cdot k \\cdot k\\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\(k^3 + 2 = k + 2k^2\\)\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n\\(k^3 - 2k^2 - k + 2 = 0\\)\n\nLet me factor this cubic equation. Maybe I can factor by grouping.\n\nGroup terms:\n\n\\((k^3 - 2k^2) + (-k + 2)\\)\n\nFactor out \\(k^2\\) from the first group and -1 from the second:\n\n\\(k^2(k - 2) - 1(k - 2)\\)\n\nNow, factor out \\((k - 2)\\):\n\n\\((k - 2)(k^2 - 1) = 0\\)\n\nSo, the solutions are \\(k = 2\\) or \\(k^2 - 1 = 0\\), which gives \\(k = 1\\) or \\(k = -1\\).\n\nTherefore, if \\(x = y = z\\), the possible solutions are \\(x = y = z = 2\\), \\(x = y = z = 1\\), or \\(x = y = z = -1\\).\n\nBut wait, I should check these solutions in the original equations to make sure they work.\n\nFirst, let's check \\(x = y = z = 2\\):\n\nSubstitute into the first equation:\n\n\\(2^2 \\cdot 2 + 2 = 2 + 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2\\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\(8 + 2 = 2 + 8\\)\n\n\\(10 = 10\\), which is true.\n\nSimilarly, the other equations will also hold because of symmetry. So, \\(x = y = z = 2\\) is a valid solution.\n\nNext, check \\(x = y = z = 1\\):\n\nFirst equation:\n\n\\(1^2 \\cdot 1 + 2 = 1 + 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1\\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\(1 + 2 = 1 + 2\\)\n\n\\(3 = 3\\), which is true. The other equations will hold as well. So, \\(x = y = z = 1\\) is also a solution.\n\nNow, check \\(x = y = z = -1\\):\n\nFirst equation:\n\n\\((-1)^2 \\cdot (-1) + 2 = -1 + 2 \\cdot (-1) \\cdot (-1)\\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\(1 \\cdot (-1) + 2 = -1 + 2 \\cdot 1\\)\n\n\\(-1 + 2 = -1 + 2\\)\n\n\\(1 = 1\\), which is true. The other equations will hold too. So, \\(x = y = z = -1\\) is another valid solution.\n\nOkay, so we have three solutions where all variables are equal. But are there any other solutions where \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) are not all equal? I need to check that.\n\nLet me consider the possibility that two variables are equal, and the third is different. For example, suppose \\(x = y \\neq z\\). Let's see if that leads to a solution.\n\nAssume \\(x = y = a\\) and \\(z = b\\), where \\(a \\neq b\\).\n\nSubstitute into the first equation:\n\n\\(a^2 \\cdot a + 2 = a + 2 \\cdot a \\cdot b\\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\(a^3 + 2 = a + 2ab\\)\n\nSimilarly, substitute into the second equation:\n\n\\(a^2 \\cdot b + 2 = a + 2 \\cdot b \\cdot a\\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\(a^2b + 2 = a + 2ab\\)\n\nAnd the third equation:\n\n\\(b^2 \\cdot a + 2 = b + 2 \\cdot a \\cdot a\\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\(ab^2 + 2 = b + 2a^2\\)\n\nSo now, we have three equations:\n\n1. \\(a^3 + 2 = a + 2ab\\)  -- Equation (1)\n2. \\(a^2b + 2 = a + 2ab\\)  -- Equation (2)\n3. \\(ab^2 + 2 = b + 2a^2\\)  -- Equation (3)\n\nLet me subtract Equation (2) from Equation (1):\n\n\\(a^3 + 2 - (a^2b + 2) = a + 2ab - (a + 2ab)\\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\(a^3 - a^2b = 0\\)\n\nFactor:\n\n\\(a^2(a - b) = 0\\)\n\nSo, either \\(a = 0\\) or \\(a = b\\). But we assumed \\(a \\neq b\\), so \\(a = 0\\) is the only possibility here.\n\nSo, if \\(a = 0\\), then from Equation (1):\n\n\\(0 + 2 = 0 + 0\\)\n\nWhich simplifies to \\(2 = 0\\), which is not true. So, this case leads to a contradiction. Therefore, there are no solutions where two variables are equal and the third is different.\n\nHmm, okay. So, maybe all variables must be equal? Or perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to manipulate the equations to find relationships between x, y, and z.\n\nLooking at the first equation:\n\n\\(x^2y + 2 = x + 2yz\\)\n\nLet me rearrange it:\n\n\\(x^2y - 2yz = x - 2\\)\n\nFactor y on the left:\n\n\\(y(x^2 - 2z) = x - 2\\)  -- Equation (1a)\n\nSimilarly, take the second equation:\n\n\\(y^2z + 2 = y + 2zx\\)\n\nRearrange:\n\n\\(y^2z - 2zx = y - 2\\)\n\nFactor z:\n\n\\(z(y^2 - 2x) = y - 2\\)  -- Equation (2a)\n\nThird equation:\n\n\\(z^2x + 2 = z + 2xy\\)\n\nRearrange:\n\n\\(z^2x - 2xy = z - 2\\)\n\nFactor x:\n\n\\(x(z^2 - 2y) = z - 2\\)  -- Equation (3a)\n\nSo now, we have:\n\n1. \\(y(x^2 - 2z) = x - 2\\)  -- (1a)\n2. \\(z(y^2 - 2x) = y - 2\\)  -- (2a)\n3. \\(x(z^2 - 2y) = z - 2\\)  -- (3a)\n\nHmm, interesting. Each equation has a similar structure. Maybe I can express each variable in terms of another.\n\nFrom Equation (1a):\n\n\\(y = \\frac{x - 2}{x^2 - 2z}\\), provided that \\(x^2 - 2z \\neq 0\\).\n\nSimilarly, from Equation (2a):\n\n\\(z = \\frac{y - 2}{y^2 - 2x}\\), provided that \\(y^2 - 2x \\neq 0\\).\n\nFrom Equation (3a):\n\n\\(x = \\frac{z - 2}{z^2 - 2y}\\), provided that \\(z^2 - 2y \\neq 0\\).\n\nThis seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can substitute these expressions into each other.\n\nLet me try substituting y from Equation (1a) into Equation (2a):\n\nFirst, from Equation (1a):\n\n\\(y = \\frac{x - 2}{x^2 - 2z}\\)\n\nSubstitute into Equation (2a):\n\n\\(z = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{x - 2}{x^2 - 2z}\\right) - 2}{\\left(\\frac{x - 2}{x^2 - 2z}\\right)^2 - 2x}\\)\n\nThis looks messy, but let's try to simplify step by step.\n\nLet me denote \\(A = x^2 - 2z\\), so \\(y = \\frac{x - 2}{A}\\).\n\nThen, Equation (2a) becomes:\n\n\\(z = \\frac{\\frac{x - 2}{A} - 2}{\\left(\\frac{x - 2}{A}\\right)^2 - 2x}\\)\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n\\(\\frac{x - 2 - 2A}{A}\\)\n\nDenominator:\n\n\\(\\frac{(x - 2)^2}{A^2} - 2x = \\frac{(x - 2)^2 - 2x A^2}{A^2}\\)\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\n\\(z = \\frac{\\frac{x - 2 - 2A}{A}}{\\frac{(x - 2)^2 - 2x A^2}{A^2}} = \\frac{(x - 2 - 2A) \\cdot A}{(x - 2)^2 - 2x A^2}\\)\n\nBut remember that \\(A = x^2 - 2z\\), so substitute back:\n\n\\(z = \\frac{(x - 2 - 2(x^2 - 2z)) \\cdot (x^2 - 2z)}{(x - 2)^2 - 2x (x^2 - 2z)^2}\\)\n\nThis is getting really complicated. Maybe this approach isn't the best.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the ratios of the equations.\n\nFrom Equation (1a): \\(y(x^2 - 2z) = x - 2\\)\n\nFrom Equation (2a): \\(z(y^2 - 2x) = y - 2\\)\n\nFrom Equation (3a): \\(x(z^2 - 2y) = z - 2\\)\n\nLet me denote:\n\nEquation (1a): \\(y = \\frac{x - 2}{x^2 - 2z}\\)\n\nEquation (2a): \\(z = \\frac{y - 2}{y^2 - 2x}\\)\n\nEquation (3a): \\(x = \\frac{z - 2}{z^2 - 2y}\\)\n\nSo, if I substitute y from Equation (1a) into Equation (2a), and then z from that into Equation (3a), I might get an equation in terms of x only. But this seems like a lot of work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider multiplying all three equations together.\n\nFrom Equations (1a), (2a), (3a):\n\n\\(y(x^2 - 2z) = x - 2\\)\n\n\\(z(y^2 - 2x) = y - 2\\)\n\n\\(x(z^2 - 2y) = z - 2\\)\n\nMultiply all three left sides and right sides:\n\n\\(y \\cdot z \\cdot x \\cdot (x^2 - 2z)(y^2 - 2x)(z^2 - 2y) = (x - 2)(y - 2)(z - 2)\\)\n\nHmm, that seems even more complicated. Maybe not the best approach.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of multiplying, I can take the product of the left sides and the product of the right sides.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe another approach.\n\nLet me consider subtracting equations from each other.\n\nTake Equation (1): \\(x^2y + 2 = x + 2yz\\)\n\nEquation (2): \\(y^2z + 2 = y + 2zx\\)\n\nSubtract Equation (2) from Equation (1):\n\n\\(x^2y - y^2z + 2 - 2 = x - y + 2yz - 2zx\\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\(x^2y - y^2z = x - y + 2yz - 2zx\\)\n\nFactor terms:\n\nLeft side: \\(y(x^2 - yz)\\)\n\nRight side: \\(x - y + 2z(y - x)\\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\(y(x^2 - yz) = (x - y) - 2z(x - y)\\)\n\nFactor right side:\n\n\\((x - y)(1 - 2z)\\)\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\\(y(x^2 - yz) = (x - y)(1 - 2z)\\)\n\nSimilarly, let's factor left side:\n\n\\(y(x^2 - yz) = yx(x - \\frac{yz}{x})\\), but that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, let's write it as:\n\n\\(y(x^2 - yz) = (x - y)(1 - 2z)\\)\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n\\(y(x^2 - yz) + (y - x)(1 - 2z) = 0\\)\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's factor out (x - y):\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, let's consider moving all terms to one side:\n\n\\(y(x^2 - yz) - (x - y)(1 - 2z) = 0\\)\n\nExpand the second term:\n\n\\(y(x^2 - yz) - (x - y) + 2z(x - y) = 0\\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\(yx^2 - y^2z - x + y + 2zx - 2zy = 0\\)\n\nHmm, not sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can factor terms with x, y, z.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let me consider the case where one of the variables is 2.\n\nSuppose x = 2. Let's see what happens.\n\nIf x = 2, substitute into the first equation:\n\n\\(2^2 y + 2 = 2 + 2 y z\\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\(4y + 2 = 2 + 2yz\\)\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides:\n\n\\(4y = 2yz\\)\n\nDivide both sides by 2y (assuming y ≠ 0):\n\n\\(2 = z\\)\n\nSo, z = 2.\n\nNow, substitute x = 2 and z = 2", "answer": "\bJedynymi trójkami x, y, z spełniającymi dane równania są: (-1, -1, -1), (1, 1, 1), (2, 2, 2)."}

Let me explore that.\n\nSuppose \\( f(0) = 0 \\). Then the equation becomes \\( f(f(x)) = f(x) \\). That would mean that \\( f \\) is a projection, i.e., applying it twice doesn't change the result. So, \\( f \\) is idempotent. Hmm, that's a property, but I don't know if that's necessarily the case yet.\n\nAlternatively, if \\( f(0) \\neq 0 \\), then \\( f \\) has some periodicity.

Hmm, not sure what to do with that yet.\n\nMaybe I can consider if \\( f \\) is linear. Let's assume \\( f(x) = kx + d \\) for some constants \\( k \\) and \\( d \\). Maybe that will help me find possible values of \\( c \\).\n\nLet me substitute \\( f(x) = kx + d \\) into the original equation:\n\nLeft-hand side (LHS):\n\\[\nf(f(x) + f(y)) + cxy = f(kx + d + ky + d) + cxy = f(kx + ky + 2d) + cxy = k(kx + ky + 2d) + d + cxy\n\\]\nSimplify:\n\\[\nk^2 x + k^2 y + 2kd + d + cxy\n\\]\n\nRight-hand side (RHS):\n\\[\nf(x + y) = k(x + y) + d = kx + ky + d\n\\]\n\nSet LHS equal to RHS:\n\\[\nk^2 x + k^2 y + 2kd + d + cxy = kx + ky + d\n\\]\n\nNow, let's collect like terms:\n\nFor \\( x \\):\n\\( k^2 x \\) on LHS, \\( kx \\) on RHS. So, \\( k^2 = k \\).\n\nFor \\( y \\):\nSimilarly, \\( k^2 y \\) on LHS, \\( ky \\) on RHS. So, \\( k^2 = k \\).\n\nFor the constant term:\n\\( 2kd + d \\) on LHS, \\( d \\) on RHS.

So, \\( c = 0 \\).\n\nSo, from \\( k^2 = k \\), we have \\( k = 0 \\) or \\( k = 1 \\).\n\nFrom \\( 2kd = 0 \\), if \\( k = 0 \\), then \\( d \\) can be anything? Wait, but let's check.\n\nIf \\( k = 0 \\), then \\( f(x) = d \\) for all \\( x \\). Let's see if that works in the original equation.\n\nIf \\( f(x) = d \\), then LHS becomes:\n\\[\nf(d + d) + cxy = f(2d) + cxy = d + cxy\n\\]\nRHS is:\n\\[\nf(x + y) = d\n\\]\nSo, \\( d + cxy = d \\) for all \\( x, y \\). That implies \\( cxy = 0 \\) for all \\( x, y \\), which is only possible if \\( c = 0 \\).\n\nSo, if \\( k = 0 \\), then \\( c = 0 \\), and \\( f(x) = d \\) is a constant function. Let me check if that works.\n\nIf \\( c = 0 \\), then the original equation becomes:\n\\[\nf(f(x) + f(y)) = f(x + y)\n\\]\nIf \\( f \\) is constant, say \\( f(x) = d \\), then LHS is \\( f(d + d) = f(2d) = d \\), and RHS is \\( f(x + y) = d \\). So, it works for any constant function when \\( c = 0 \\).\n\nNow, if \\( k = 1 \\), then from \\( 2kd = 0 \\), we have \\( 2d = 0 \\), so \\( d = 0 \\). Therefore, \\( f(x) = x \\).\n\nLet me check if \\( f(x) = x \\) satisfies the original equation with \\( c \\) determined.\n\nSubstitute \\( f(x) = x \\) into the equation:\n\nLHS:\n\\[\nf(f(x) + f(y)) + cxy = f(x + y) + cxy = (x + y) + cxy\n\\]\nRHS:\n\\[\nf(x + y) = x + y\n\\]\nSo, setting LHS equal to RHS:\n\\[\nx + y + cxy = x + y\n\\]\nWhich implies \\( cxy = 0 \\) for all \\( x, y \\). Therefore, \\( c = 0 \\).\n\nSo, in the case of \\( k = 1 \\), we also get \\( c = 0 \\).\n\nWait, so whether \\( k = 0 \\) or \\( k = 1 \\), we end up with \\( c = 0 \\). So, if \\( f \\) is linear, then \\( c \\) must be zero.\n\nBut the problem is asking for all real numbers \\( c \\) for which such a function exists. So, maybe \\( c = 0 \\) is a possible value. But are there other values of \\( c \\) where a non-linear function \\( f \\) could satisfy the equation?\n\nI need to check if \\( c \\) can be non-zero. Let's see.\n\nSuppose \\( c \\neq 0 \\). Then, perhaps \\( f \\) is not linear. Maybe quadratic? Let me try assuming \\( f(x) \\) is quadratic, say \\( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + d \\). But that might complicate things, but let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \\( f \\) is additive or multiplicative. Let me think.\n\nWait, another approach: suppose I set \\( x = y \\). Wait, I already did that earlier, but let me see.\n\nWait, when I set \\( y = x \\), I got:\n\n\\[\nf(2f(x)) + c x^2 = f(2x)\n\\]\n\nIf I can express \\( f(2f(x)) \\) in terms of \\( f(2x) \\), maybe I can find a relation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the function being injective or surjective. Let me see.\n\nSuppose \\( f \\) is injective. Then, from \\( f(f(x) + f(0)) = f(x) \\), injectivity would imply \\( f(x) + f(0) = x \\). So, \\( f(x) = x - f(0) \\). Let me see if that works.\n\nLet me denote \\( f(0) = d \\). So, \\( f(x) = x - d \\).\n\nLet me substitute this into the original equation:\n\nLHS:\n\\[\nf(f(x) + f(y)) + cxy = f((x - d) + (y - d)) + cxy = f(x + y - 2d) + cxy = (x + y - 2d - d) + cxy = x + y - 3d + cxy\n\\]\nRHS:\n\\[\nf(x + y) = (x + y) - d\n\\]\nSet LHS equal to RHS:\n\\[\nx + y - 3d + cxy = x + y - d\n\\]\nSimplify:\n\\[\n-3d + cxy = -d\n\\]\nWhich implies:\n\\[\ncxy = 2d\n\\]\nBut this must hold for all \\( x, y \\). The only way this can be true is if \\( c = 0 \\) and \\( 2d = 0 \\), so \\( d = 0 \\). Therefore, \\( f(x) = x \\). But earlier, when \\( f(x) = x \\), we saw that \\( c \\) must be zero. So, this doesn't give us a new solution.\n\nSo, if \\( f \\) is injective, then \\( c = 0 \\) is the only possibility.\n\nAlternatively, suppose \\( f \\) is not injective. Maybe it's constant, which we already considered when \\( k = 0 \\). In that case, \\( c = 0 \\) as well.\n\nWait, so whether \\( f \\) is injective or constant, \\( c \\) must be zero. So, is \\( c = 0 \\) the only possible value?\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe there's a non-injective, non-constant function \\( f \\) that works for some \\( c \\neq 0 \\).\n\nLet me try to see if such a function exists.\n\nSuppose \\( c \\neq 0 \\). Let me see if I can find a function \\( f \\) that satisfies the equation.\n\nLet me consider the case when \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( y = 1 \\). Then:\n\n\\[\nf(f(1) + f(1)) + c \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = f(2)\n\\]\nSimplify:\n\\[\nf(2f(1)) + c = f(2)\n\\]\nSo, \\( f(2f(1)) = f(2) - c \\).\n\nSimilarly, if I set \\( x = 2 \\) and \\( y = 0 \\):\n\n\\[\nf(f(2) + f(0)) + c \\cdot 2 \\cdot 0 = f(2 + 0)\n\\]\nSimplify:\n\\[\nf(f(2) + f(0)) = f(2)\n\\]\nSo, \\( f(f(2) + f(0)) = f(2) \\). Hmm, similar to the earlier equation when \\( y = 0 \\).\n\nWait, earlier when \\( y = 0 \\), we had \\( f(f(x) + f(0)) = f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\). So, in particular, for \\( x = 2 \\), \\( f(f(2) + f(0)) = f(2) \\). So, that's consistent.\n\nBut I don't see how that helps me yet.\n\nLet me try to see if I can express \\( f(x + y) \\) in terms of \\( f(f(x) + f(y)) \\) and \\( cxy \\). Maybe I can find a recursive relation or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the function \\( f \\) being quadratic. Let me assume \\( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + d \\). Let's see if that works.\n\nBut this might get complicated, but let's try.\n\nCompute LHS:\n\\[\nf(f(x) + f(y)) + cxy = a(f(x) + f(y))^2 + b(f(x) + f(y)) + d + cxy\n\\]\nWhich is:\n\\[\na(ax^2 + bx + d + ay^2 + by + d)^2 + b(ax^2 + bx + d + ay^2 + by + d) + d + cxy\n\\]\nThat's a quartic in \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), which seems too complicated. The RHS is \\( f(x + y) = a(x + y)^2 + b(x + y) + d \\), which is quadratic. So, unless the quartic terms cancel out, which seems unlikely, this approach might not work. So, maybe \\( f \\) isn't quadratic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \\( f \\) is linear plus a constant, but we already saw that leads to \\( c = 0 \\).\n\nWait, another idea: suppose \\( f \\) is additive, meaning \\( f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) \\). But additive functions over the reals are linear if they're continuous, but without continuity, they can be pathological. But let's see.\n\nIf \\( f \\) is additive, then \\( f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) \\). Let's substitute into the original equation:\n\nLHS:\n\\[\nf(f(x) + f(y)) + cxy = f(f(x) + f(y)) + cxy\n\\]\nBut since \\( f \\) is additive, \\( f(f(x) + f(y)) = f(f(x)) + f(f(y)) \\). So,\n\nLHS becomes:\n\\[\nf(f(x)) + f(f(y)) + cxy\n\\]\nRHS is:\n\\[\nf(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)\n\\]\nSo, the equation becomes:\n", "answer": "**Rozwiązanie:**  \nUdowodnimy, że jedyną liczbą rzeczywistą \\( c \\), dla której istnieje funkcja \\( f \\) o żądanych własnościach jest \\( c = 0 \\).\n\nPo pierwsze zauważmy, że jeżeli \\( c = 0 \\), to dowolna funkcja stała spełnia warunki zadania.  \nNiech \\( c > 0 \\) będzie taką liczbą rzeczywistą, że istnieje funkcja \\( f \\) o żądanych własnościach.

Hmm, interesting. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably consider the structure of each expression. Each fraction has a numerator that's the sum of two variables and a denominator that's a quadratic expression in those two variables. The denominator looks like \\(x^2 + xy + y^2\\), which reminds me of the expansion of \\((x + y)^2 - xy\\), but I'm not sure if that helps yet.\n\nSince the problem is about equality of two of these fractions, maybe I can set two of them equal and see what that implies about \\(a, b, c\\). Let's say, for example, that the first and the second fractions are equal. So:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a + b}{a^2 + ab + b^2} = \\frac{b + c}{b^2 + bc + c^2}\n\\]\n\nI can cross-multiply to eliminate the denominators:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)(b^2 + bc + c^2) = (b + c)(a^2 + ab + b^2)\n\\]\n\nLet me expand both sides:\n\nLeft side:\n\\[\n(a + b)(b^2 + bc + c^2) = a(b^2 + bc + c^2) + b(b^2 + bc + c^2) = ab^2 + abc + ac^2 + b^3 + b^2c + bc^2\n\\]\n\nRight side:\n\\[\n(b + c)(a^2 + ab + b^2) = b(a^2 + ab + b^2) + c(a^2 + ab + b^2) = a^2b + ab^2 + b^3 + a^2c + abc + b^2c\n\\]\n\nNow, let's subtract the right side from the left side to see what we get:\n\nLeft - Right:\n\\[\n(ab^2 + abc + ac^2 + b^3 + b^2c + bc^2) - (a^2b + ab^2 + b^3 + a^2c + abc + b^2c)\n\\]\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n- \\(ab^2 - ab^2 = 0\\)\n- \\(abc - abc = 0\\)\n- \\(ac^2 - a^2c = ac(c - a)\\)\n- \\(b^3 - b^3 = 0\\)\n- \\(b^2c - b^2c = 0\\)\n- \\(bc^2 - a^2b = b(c^2 - a^2) = b(c - a)(c + a)\\)\n\nSo, combining the remaining terms:\n\n\\[\nac(c - a) + b(c - a)(c + a) = (c - a)(ac + b(c + a))\n\\]\n\nFactor out \\((c - a)\\):\n\n\\[\n(c - a)(ac + bc + ab) = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, either \\(c - a = 0\\) or \\(ac + bc + ab = 0\\).\n\nBut \\(c - a = 0\\) would imply \\(c = a\\), but the problem states that \\(a, b, c\\) are distinct, so this is not allowed. Therefore, we must have:\n\n\\[\nac + bc + ab = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, from setting the first two fractions equal, we get the condition \\(ab + bc + ac = 0\\).\n\nNow, let's see what happens if we set another pair equal. Let's say the second and third fractions are equal:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b + c}{b^2 + bc + c^2} = \\frac{c + a}{c^2 + ca + a^2}\n\\]\n\nAgain, cross-multiplying:\n\n\\[\n(b + c)(c^2 + ca + a^2) = (c + a)(b^2 + bc + c^2)\n\\]\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft side:\n\\[\n(b + c)(c^2 + ca + a^2) = b(c^2 + ca + a^2) + c(c^2 + ca + a^2) = bc^2 + bca + ba^2 + c^3 + c^2a + ca^2\n\\]\n\nRight side:\n\\[\n(c + a)(b^2 + bc + c^2) = c(b^2 + bc + c^2) + a(b^2 + bc + c^2) = cb^2 + bc^2 + c^3 + ab^2 + abc + ac^2\n\\]\n\nSubtracting right side from left side:\n\nLeft - Right:\n\\[\n(bc^2 + bca + ba^2 + c^3 + c^2a + ca^2) - (cb^2 + bc^2 + c^3 + ab^2 + abc + ac^2)\n\\]\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n- \\(bc^2 - bc^2 = 0\\)\n- \\(bca - abc = 0\\)\n- \\(ba^2 - ab^2 = a^2b - ab^2 = ab(a - b)\\)\n- \\(c^3 - c^3 = 0\\)\n- \\(c^2a - ac^2 = 0\\)\n- \\(ca^2 - ab^2 = a^2c - ab^2 = a(a c - b^2)\\)\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake in the last term. Let me check:\n\nWait, the left side has \\(ca^2\\) and the right side has \\(ac^2\\). So, \\(ca^2 - ac^2 = a^2c - a c^2 = ac(a - c)\\). Hmm, that's different.\n\nWait, let me re-examine:\n\nLeft side after expansion: bc^2 + bca + ba^2 + c^3 + c^2a + ca^2\n\nRight side after expansion: cb^2 + bc^2 + c^3 + ab^2 + abc + ac^2\n\nSo, subtracting term by term:\n\n- bc^2 - bc^2 = 0\n- bca - abc = 0\n- ba^2 - ab^2 = a^2b - ab^2 = ab(a - b)\n- c^3 - c^3 = 0\n- c^2a - ac^2 = 0\n- ca^2 - ac^2 = a^2c - a c^2 = ac(a - c)\n\nSo, combining the remaining terms:\n\n\\[\nab(a - b) + ac(a - c) = 0\n\\]\n\nFactor out 'a':\n\n\\[\na [b(a - b) + c(a - c)] = 0\n\\]\n\nSince \\(a\\) is non-zero (given), we have:\n\n\\[\nb(a - b) + c(a - c) = 0\n\\]\n\nExpanding:\n\n\\[\nab - b^2 + ac - c^2 = 0\n\\]\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\n\\[\nab + ac - b^2 - c^2 = 0\n\\]\n\nHmm, that's another condition. So, from setting the second and third fractions equal, we get \\(ab + ac - b^2 - c^2 = 0\\).\n\nNow, let's see if we can combine this with the previous condition we had from setting the first two fractions equal, which was \\(ab + bc + ac = 0\\).\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\n1. \\(ab + bc + ac = 0\\)\n2. \\(ab + ac - b^2 - c^2 = 0\\)\n\nLet me write them down:\n\n1. \\(ab + bc + ac = 0\\)\n2. \\(ab + ac = b^2 + c^2\\)\n\nFrom equation 1, we can express \\(ab + ac = -bc\\). Plugging this into equation 2:\n\n\\[\n- bc = b^2 + c^2\n\\]\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[\nb^2 + bc + c^2 = 0\n\\]\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, \\(b^2 + bc + c^2 = 0\\). But \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) are real numbers. Let me think about this equation.\n\nThe expression \\(b^2 + bc + c^2\\) is always non-negative for real numbers because it's equivalent to \\(\\frac{3}{4}(b + c)^2 + \\frac{1}{4}(b - c)^2\\), which is a sum of squares. Therefore, \\(b^2 + bc + c^2 = 0\\) only when both \\(b = 0\\) and \\(c = 0\\). But the problem states that all numbers are non-zero, so this is impossible.\n\nHmm, that's a contradiction. So, if we set the first two fractions equal, we get \\(ab + bc + ac = 0\\), and setting the second and third equal gives \\(ab + ac = b^2 + c^2\\), which leads to \\(b^2 + bc + c^2 = 0\\), which is impossible for non-zero real numbers. Therefore, this suggests that our initial assumption that two fractions are equal might not hold, or perhaps we need to consider another pair.\n\nWait, maybe I should try setting the first and third fractions equal instead. Let's try that.\n\nSet:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{a + b}{a^2 + ab + b^2} = \\frac{c + a}{c^2 + ca + a^2}\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n\\[\n(a + b)(c^2 + ca + a^2) = (c + a)(a^2 + ab + b^2)\n\\]\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft side:\n\\[\n(a + b)(c^2 + ca + a^2) = a(c^2 + ca + a^2) + b(c^2 + ca + a^2) = a c^2 + a^2 c + a^3 + b c^2 + b c a + b a^2\n\\]\n\nRight side:\n\\[\n(c + a)(a^2 + ab + b^2) = c(a^2 + ab + b^2) + a(a^2 + ab + b^2) = c a^2 + a b c + c b^2 + a^3 + a^2 b + a b^2\n\\]\n\nSubtracting right side from left side:\n\nLeft - Right:\n\\[\n(a c^2 + a^2 c + a^3 + b c^2 + b c a + b a^2) - (c a^2 + a b c + c b^2 + a^3 + a^2 b + a b^2)\n\\]\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n- \\(a c^2 - c a^2 = a c^2 - a^2 c = a c (c - a)\\)\n- \\(a^2 c - a^2 b = a^2 (c - b)\\)\n- \\(a^3 - a^3 = 0\\)\n- \\(b c^2 - c b^2 = b c^2 - b^2 c = b c (c - b)\\)\n- \\(b c a - a b c = 0\\)\n- \\(b a^2 - a^2 b = 0\\)\n\nSo, combining the remaining terms:\n\n\\[\na c (c - a) + a^2 (c - b) + b c (c - b) = 0\n\\]\n\nFactor terms where possible:\n\nLet me factor out \\((c - b)\\) from the last two terms:\n\n\\[\na c (c - a) + (c - b)(a^2 + b c) = 0\n\\]\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe let's factor differently.\n\nAlternatively, let's collect like terms:\n\n- Terms with \\(c - a\\): \\(a c (c - a)\\)\n- Terms with \\(c - b\\): \\(a^2 (c - b) + b c (c - b) = (a^2 + b c)(c - b)\\)\n\nSo, overall:\n\n\\[\na c (c - a) + (a^2 + b c)(c - b) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can factor further or find a relationship.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express \\(c\\) in terms of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) from the first condition \\(ab + bc + ac = 0\\). Let's recall that from setting the first two fractions equal, we had \\(ab + bc + ac = 0\\).

Rozstrzygnąć, czy α musi być liczbą wymierną.", "response": "Okay, so I have this problem where I need to determine if α must be a rational number given that the tangent of α times π is equal to the square root of 2. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the tangent function, tan(x), is periodic with a period of π. That means tan(x + π) = tan(x) for any x. So, if tan(απ) = √2, then tan(απ + kπ) = √2 for any integer k. But I'm not sure if that helps me directly with determining if α is rational.\n\nI remember that tan(π/4) is 1, and tan(π/3) is √3, but √2 isn't one of the standard tangent values I know off the top of my head. Maybe I can express απ in terms of an angle whose tangent is √2. Let me denote θ = απ, so tan(θ) = √2. Then θ = arctan(√2) + kπ for some integer k.\n\nSo, α = (arctan(√2) + kπ)/π. Simplifying that, α = (arctan(√2))/π + k. Since k is an integer, α can be written as arctan(√2)/π plus an integer. Now, the question is whether arctan(√2)/π is rational or not.\n\nI recall that arctan(√2) is an irrational multiple of π. Wait, is that true? Let me think. I know that angles like π/4, π/3, π/6 have rational multiples, but arctan(√2) isn't one of those standard angles. In fact, I think arctan(√2) is not a rational multiple of π. \n\nBut how can I be sure? Maybe I can use some properties of transcendental numbers or something related to Niven's theorem. Niven's theorem states that the only rational values of θ between 0 and π/2 for which both sin(θ) and cos(θ) are rational are 0, π/6, π/4, and π/3. But here, we're dealing with tangent, not sine or cosine.\n\nWait, maybe I can relate tangent to sine and cosine. Since tan(θ) = sin(θ)/cos(θ), and if tan(θ) is √2, then sin(θ) = √2 cos(θ). Also, since sin²(θ) + cos²(θ) = 1, substituting gives 2 cos²(θ) + cos²(θ) = 1, so 3 cos²(θ) = 1, which means cos(θ) = ±1/√3. Therefore, sin(θ) = ±√2/√3.\n\nSo, sin(θ) and cos(θ) are both irrational numbers here. According to Niven's theorem, if θ is a rational multiple of π, then sin(θ) and cos(θ) must be algebraic numbers, but they don't necessarily have to be rational. However, Niven's theorem specifically says that the only rational angles (in terms of multiples of π) with both sine and cosine rational are those I mentioned earlier. Since √2/√3 and 1/√3 are irrational, does that mean θ cannot be a rational multiple of π?\n\nWait, no. Niven's theorem doesn't say that if sine and cosine are irrational, then the angle isn't a rational multiple of π. It just says that if the angle is a rational multiple of π, then sine and cosine can only be rational for specific angles. So, in this case, since tan(θ) is √2, which is irrational, and sin(θ) and cos(θ) are also irrational, it doesn't necessarily mean θ isn't a rational multiple of π. It just means that θ isn't one of those special angles where sine and cosine are rational.\n\nSo, maybe θ could still be a rational multiple of π even if tan(θ) is irrational. For example, take θ = π/4, tan(θ) is 1, which is rational. But if θ is something like π/6, tan(θ) is √3/3, which is irrational. So, having an irrational tangent doesn't automatically make the angle an irrational multiple of π.\n\nHmm, so I need another approach. Maybe I can use the fact that if α is rational, then απ is a rational multiple of π, and then tan(απ) would be an algebraic number. But √2 is also algebraic, so that doesn't help.\n\nWait, but more specifically, if α is rational, say α = p/q where p and q are integers, then tan(pπ/q) is algebraic. But is √2 equal to tan(pπ/q) for some integers p and q? I don't think so. Because the tangent of a rational multiple of π is either rational or a specific algebraic number, but √2 is not one of those.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that if α is rational, then e^{iαπ} is an algebraic number on the unit circle. But I'm not sure how that connects to tan(απ).\n\nWait, another idea: if α is rational, then απ is a rational multiple of π, and the tangent of such an angle is either rational or a specific algebraic number. But √2 is not a tangent of any rational multiple of π. Because, for example, tan(π/4) is 1, tan(π/3) is √3, tan(π/6) is 1/√3, tan(π/2) is undefined, etc. None of these give √2.\n\nSo, if tan(απ) = √2, and √2 is not the tangent of any rational multiple of π, then α cannot be rational. Therefore, α must be irrational.\n\nWait, but is that a valid conclusion? I need to make sure that there isn't some rational α where tan(απ) = √2. Suppose α is rational, say α = p/q, then tan(pπ/q) = √2. But from what I know, the tangent of a rational multiple of π is either rational or a specific algebraic number, but √2 is not among those. Therefore, such a rational α cannot exist.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that if α is rational, then tan(απ) is algebraic, but √2 is algebraic, so that doesn't help. Wait, but more precisely, if α is rational, then tan(απ) is either rational or a specific algebraic number, but √2 is not one of those specific algebraic numbers that can be expressed as tan(pπ/q).

Let me try to understand it step by step. \n\nFirst, the problem defines a \"cycle\" on an n x n chessboard. A cycle is a sequence of distinct squares (a1, a2, ..., ak) where each consecutive pair of squares shares a common side, and the last square connects back to the first. Importantly, the cycle must have at least 4 squares. So, it's like a loop that doesn't cross itself and has at least four sides.\n\nThen, a subset X of the squares is called \"evil\" if every cycle on the chessboard contains at least one square from X. So, X is like a hitting set for all cycles on the board. The question is asking for all real numbers C such that for every integer n ≥ 2, there exists an evil subset X with at most Cn² squares.\n\nHmm, so I need to find the minimal C such that no matter how big the chessboard is, I can always find an evil set that's not too large—specifically, its size is proportional to C times the total number of squares.\n\nLet me think about smaller chessboards first to get an intuition.\n\nFor n=2, the chessboard is 2x2. How many cycles are there? Well, the smallest cycle is a square, which is 4 squares. So, the only cycle is the entire board. Therefore, the evil set X must include at least one square from this cycle. So, the minimal evil set has size 1. Since the total number of squares is 4, C would be 1/4 in this case.\n\nBut wait, the problem says for every n ≥ 2, so n=2 is just a starting point. Let's check n=3.\n\nFor a 3x3 chessboard, the number of cycles is more. The smallest cycles are still 4-square cycles, but there are also larger ones. For example, the outer perimeter is a cycle of length 8, and there are smaller cycles inside. To create an evil set, we need to place squares such that every possible cycle includes at least one of them.\n\nWhat's a good strategy? Maybe placing squares in a checkerboard pattern? If I color the board like a checkerboard, with alternating black and white squares, and choose all the black squares, does that work? Let's see.\n\nIn a checkerboard pattern, every cycle must alternate between black and white squares. Since a cycle has an even number of squares (because each move changes color), the number of black and white squares in a cycle is equal. So, if I take all black squares, which is half the board, then every cycle must include at least one black square. Wait, is that true?\n\nWait, no. If I take all black squares, then any cycle that alternates between black and white would have to include black squares. But if I remove all black squares, then the remaining white squares can't form a cycle because they are not connected in a cycle. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the evil set needs to be a vertex cover for all cycles. In graph theory terms, the chessboard can be represented as a graph where each square is a vertex, and edges connect adjacent squares. Then, a cycle is a cycle in this graph, and an evil set is a hitting set for all cycles.\n\nSo, in graph terms, we're looking for a hitting set for all cycles in the grid graph. The minimal size of such a hitting set is what we're after, scaled by n².\n\nI remember that in grid graphs, the problem of finding a hitting set for cycles is related to feedback vertex sets. A feedback vertex set is a set of vertices whose removal makes the graph acyclic. So, an evil set is essentially a feedback vertex set.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the minimal C such that for any n x n grid graph, there exists a feedback vertex set of size at most Cn².\n\nI think feedback vertex sets in grid graphs have been studied. Let me recall. For an n x n grid, the feedback vertex set problem is to find the smallest set of vertices that intersects every cycle.\n\nI remember that for planar graphs, which grid graphs are, there are some known bounds. But I'm not sure about the exact value for grids.\n\nWait, in a grid graph, the number of vertices is n², and the number of edges is roughly 2n(n-1). The grid is bipartite, so it doesn't have any odd-length cycles. All cycles are of even length, at least 4.\n\nIn bipartite graphs, the feedback vertex set problem is equivalent to finding a set of vertices that intersects every cycle. Since the grid is bipartite, maybe we can use some properties of bipartite graphs.\n\nIn bipartite graphs, the size of the minimum feedback vertex set is equal to the number of vertices minus the size of the maximum induced forest. But I'm not sure if that helps directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the fact that in a grid, the cycles are all of even length, and perhaps a checkerboard pattern can help. If we color the grid in a checkerboard fashion, then every cycle must alternate between black and white squares. So, if we take all the black squares, which is half the grid, then every cycle must include at least one black square. Wait, but that's not necessarily true because a cycle could be entirely on white squares if the grid is colored differently.\n\nWait, no. In a checkerboard coloring, each square is colored black or white such that no two adjacent squares share the same color. So, any cycle must alternate between black and white. Therefore, any cycle must contain at least two black squares and two white squares. So, if we take all black squares, then every cycle must include at least one black square. Therefore, the set of all black squares is a feedback vertex set.\n\nBut the size of this set is n²/2, so C would be 1/2. But is this the minimal C? Maybe we can do better.\n\nWait, perhaps we can do better by not taking all black squares but a subset. For example, if we take every other square in a row or column, maybe we can cover all cycles with fewer squares.\n\nAlternatively, think about the grid as a graph and try to find a feedback vertex set. I recall that for grid graphs, the feedback vertex set can be as small as roughly n²/4. Let me see.\n\nIf we take every other square in both rows and columns, forming a checkerboard of a different kind, maybe that's sufficient. For example, in a 4x4 grid, if we take the squares (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), (3,3), etc., that's 4 squares, which is 1/4 of the grid. Does this set intersect every cycle?\n\nWait, in a 4x4 grid, the outer cycle is 12 squares. If we take the four corners, does that intersect every cycle? No, because there are inner cycles that don't include the corners. For example, the inner 2x2 square is a cycle of 4 squares, none of which are the corners. So, taking only the corners wouldn't hit that inner cycle.\n\nSo, maybe taking every other square in a checkerboard pattern isn't sufficient. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a diagonal pattern? If we take squares along the main diagonal, but that might not cover all cycles either.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to model the grid as a graph and use known results about feedback vertex sets in grid graphs.\n\nAfter a quick search in my mind, I recall that for an n x n grid, the minimum feedback vertex set has size roughly n²/4. Specifically, it's known that the feedback vertex set number for an n x n grid is Θ(n²). But I need the exact constant.\n\nWait, actually, I think that the feedback vertex set for a grid can be constructed by selecting every other vertex in a checkerboard pattern, but only one color class. Wait, no, that's the vertex cover, which is different.\n\nWait, no, in bipartite graphs, the vertex cover is related to the maximum matching, but feedback vertex set is different.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. If we can partition the grid into smaller components, each of which is a tree, then the feedback vertex set would be the set of vertices whose removal makes the graph a forest.\n\nIn a grid, which is a planar graph, the feedback vertex set can be found by considering the dual graph, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about the grid as a bipartite graph with partitions A and B. If we remove all vertices from A, the remaining graph is an independent set, which is a forest (since it has no edges). Similarly, removing all vertices from B also results in a forest. So, the size of the feedback vertex set is at most n²/2, which is the size of the smaller partition.\n\nBut is this the minimal? Or can we do better?\n\nWait, in a bipartite graph, the feedback vertex set is equal to the number of vertices minus the size of the maximum induced forest. But I'm not sure how to compute that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal feedback vertex set in a grid is actually n²/4. Let me think about a 4x4 grid. The total number of squares is 16. If I can find a feedback vertex set of size 4, that would be 1/4 of the grid.\n\nWait, in a 4x4 grid, if I take the four center squares, does that hit all cycles? Let's see. The outer cycle is 12 squares, which doesn't include the center squares. So, that wouldn't work. Alternatively, if I take every other square in a checkerboard pattern, that's 8 squares, which is 1/2. But maybe I can do better.\n\nWait, perhaps if I take a diagonal stripe. For example, in a 4x4 grid, take the main diagonal and the one above it. That's 4 squares. Does that hit all cycles? Let's see. The outer cycle would include some of these squares, but the inner 2x2 cycle might not. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a better approach is to use the fact that in a grid, the feedback vertex set can be constructed by selecting every third row or something like that. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, I think I remember that for an n x n grid, the minimum feedback vertex set has size roughly n²/4. Specifically, it's known that the feedback vertex set number is Θ(n²), and the constant is 1/4. So, C would be 1/4.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, let's think about dividing the grid into 2x2 blocks. Each 2x2 block has a cycle of 4 squares. To hit each such cycle, we need to include at least one square from each 2x2 block in our feedback set. So, if we take one square from each 2x2 block, that would be n²/4 squares. For example, take the top-left square of each 2x2 block. This would ensure that every 2x2 cycle is hit. But does this also hit larger cycles?\n\nWait, a larger cycle, say, going around the entire grid, would pass through multiple 2x2 blocks, each contributing a square to the feedback set. So, the cycle would include at least one square from each 2x2 block it passes through, but does it necessarily include one of the selected squares?\n\nWait, no. Because the cycle could go around the grid without passing through any of the selected squares if they are placed in a way that the cycle can avoid them. For example, if the selected squares are all in the top-left of each 2x2 block, a cycle that goes around the perimeter of the entire grid might not include any of these squares.\n\nWait, in a 4x4 grid, the outer cycle is 12 squares. If I take the top-left squares of each 2x2 block, that's 4 squares. The outer cycle doesn't include any of these 4 squares, so this set wouldn't hit the outer cycle. Therefore, this approach doesn't work.\n\nHmm, so maybe taking one square from each 2x2 block isn't sufficient because larger cycles can avoid them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better way is to use a checkerboard pattern but with a different density. For example, if we color the grid in a way that every other row is offset, creating a pattern where every cycle must include a square from the evil set.\n\nWait, another idea: if we remove every other diagonal, maybe that would break all cycles. For example, in a grid, if we remove all squares on the main diagonal, does that break all cycles? Probably not, because there are still cycles that don't include the main diagonal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a more efficient way is to use a pattern where every third square is removed, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for known results. I recall that in grid graphs, the feedback vertex set problem is NP-hard, but for planar graphs, there are approximation algorithms. However, since we're looking for an upper bound, maybe a known construction exists.\n\nWait, I think that in an n x n grid, a feedback vertex set of size n²/4 is sufficient. Here's why: if we color the grid in a checkerboard pattern, but instead of taking all black squares, we take every other black square in a way that ensures coverage.\n\nWait, no, that might not be sufficient. Alternatively, maybe a more efficient way is to partition the grid into 2x2 blocks and take one square from each block, but as I saw earlier, that doesn't necessarily cover all cycles.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to use a diagonal stripe. For example, in each row, take every other square, offset by one in the next row. This creates a pattern where every cycle must cross this stripe.\n\nWait, let me think about a specific example. In a 4x4 grid, if I take the squares (1,1), (1,3), (2,2), (2,4), (3,1), (3,3), (4,2), (4,4). That's 8 squares, which is half the grid. But maybe I can do better.\n\nWait, perhaps if I take every third square in a diagonal pattern, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal C is 1/2, as taking all black squares in a checkerboard pattern ensures that every cycle is hit, and this is the minimal C. But earlier, I thought that maybe 1/4 is possible, but my example with the 4x4 grid showed that taking 1/4 wasn't sufficient.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I take all black squares, which is half the grid, then every cycle must include at least one black square because cycles alternate colors. So, that works, and the size is n²/2. But is there a smaller set?\n\nWait, perhaps if I take a subset of the black squares, but arranged in such a way that every cycle still includes at least one. For example, if I take every other black square in a row, but offset in the next row, creating a pattern that still intersects every cycle.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's not possible to go below 1/2. Because if you have a cycle", "answer": "Udowodnimy, że wszystkie liczby \\(C \\geq \\frac{1}{3}\\) spełniają warunki zadania.

I need to figure out what P and Q could be. Let me start by thinking about the degrees of these polynomials. Maybe that can give me some clues.\n\nLet’s denote the degree of P as deg(P) = m and the degree of Q as deg(Q) = n. \n\nLooking at the first equation: \\( P(x^2 + 1) = Q(x)^2 + 2x \\). The left side, P(x² + 1), will have degree 2m because substituting x² + 1 into a degree m polynomial gives degree 2m. On the right side, Q(x)² is a square of a degree n polynomial, so it has degree 2n, and 2x is degree 1. So, the highest degree term on the right is 2n. Therefore, equating the degrees from both sides, we have 2m = 2n. So, m = n. That means P and Q have the same degree.\n\nNow, looking at the second equation: \\( Q(x^2 + 1) = P(x)^2 \\). Similarly, the left side is Q(x² + 1), which has degree 2n, and the right side is P(x)², which has degree 2m. Since m = n, this is consistent.\n\nSo, both P and Q have the same degree, say m. Let me think about possible small degrees and see if I can find such polynomials.\n\nLet’s start with the simplest case: degree 0. If P and Q are constants, then:\n\nFrom the first equation: P = Q² + 2x. But 2x is not a constant, so this is impossible. So, degree 0 is out.\n\nNext, degree 1. Let’s assume P(x) = ax + b and Q(x) = cx + d.\n\nLet me plug into the first equation:\n\nP(x² + 1) = a(x² + 1) + b = ax² + a + b.\n\nOn the other side, Q(x)² + 2x = (cx + d)² + 2x = c²x² + 2cdx + d² + 2x.\n\nSo, equate coefficients:\n\nax² + (a + b) = c²x² + (2cd + 2)x + d².\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\n1. Coefficient of x²: a = c²\n2. Coefficient of x: 0 = 2cd + 2\n3. Constant term: a + b = d²\n\nSimilarly, let's plug into the second equation:\n\nQ(x² + 1) = c(x² + 1) + d = cx² + c + d.\n\nOn the other side, P(x)² = (ax + b)² = a²x² + 2abx + b².\n\nEquate coefficients:\n\ncx² + (c + d) = a²x² + 2abx + b².\n\nSo, we have:\n\n1. Coefficient of x²: c = a²\n2. Coefficient of x: 0 = 2ab\n3. Constant term: c + d = b²\n\nNow, let's collect all the equations we have:\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\n1. a = c²\n2. 0 = 2cd + 2\n3. a + b = d²\n\nFrom the second equation:\n\n4. c = a²\n5. 0 = 2ab\n6. c + d = b²\n\nSo, let's see. From equation 5: 0 = 2ab. So either a = 0 or b = 0.\n\nCase 1: a = 0.\n\nIf a = 0, then from equation 1: a = c² => 0 = c² => c = 0.\n\nFrom equation 4: c = a² => 0 = 0, which is fine.\n\nFrom equation 2: 0 = 2cd + 2 => 0 = 0 + 2 => 0 = 2, which is a contradiction. So, this case is impossible.\n\nCase 2: b = 0.\n\nIf b = 0, then from equation 3: a + 0 = d² => a = d².\n\nFrom equation 5: 0 = 2a*0 = 0, which is fine.\n\nFrom equation 1: a = c².\n\nFrom equation 4: c = a².\n\nSo, we have a = c² and c = a². Let me substitute c = a² into a = c²:\n\na = (a²)² = a⁴.\n\nSo, a⁴ - a = 0 => a(a³ - 1) = 0 => a = 0 or a³ = 1 => a = 1.\n\nIf a = 0, then c = a² = 0. Then from equation 2: 0 = 2cd + 2 => 0 = 0 + 2 => 0 = 2, which is a contradiction. So, a cannot be 0.\n\nIf a = 1, then c = a² = 1. From equation 3: a = d² => 1 = d² => d = 1 or d = -1.\n\nFrom equation 2: 0 = 2cd + 2. Let's plug c = 1:\n\n0 = 2*1*d + 2 => 2d + 2 = 0 => d = -1.\n\nSo, d = -1.\n\nFrom equation 6: c + d = b². Since b = 0, we have c + d = 0. Let's check: c = 1, d = -1, so 1 + (-1) = 0, which is correct.\n\nSo, in this case, a = 1, c = 1, b = 0, d = -1.\n\nTherefore, P(x) = ax + b = x + 0 = x.\n\nQ(x) = cx + d = x - 1.\n\nLet me verify if these satisfy both equations.\n\nFirst equation: P(x² + 1) = (x² + 1). On the other side, Q(x)² + 2x = (x - 1)² + 2x = x² - 2x + 1 + 2x = x² + 1. So, that works.\n\nSecond equation: Q(x² + 1) = (x² + 1) - 1 = x². On the other side, P(x)² = x². So, that also works.\n\nGreat, so P(x) = x and Q(x) = x - 1 is a solution.\n\nNow, let me check if there are higher degree solutions. Let's assume that P and Q are of degree 2.\n\nLet’s suppose P(x) = ax² + bx + c and Q(x) = dx² + ex + f.\n\nBut before going into that, maybe I can think about functional equations. Let me see if I can find a relationship between P and Q.\n\nFrom the first equation: P(x² + 1) = Q(x)² + 2x.\n\nFrom the second equation: Q(x² + 1) = P(x)².\n\nSo, if I substitute x² + 1 into the second equation, I get Q((x² + 1)^2 + 1) = P(x² + 1)^2.\n\nBut from the first equation, P(x² + 1) = Q(x)^2 + 2x, so P(x² + 1)^2 = (Q(x)^2 + 2x)^2.\n\nTherefore, Q((x² + 1)^2 + 1) = (Q(x)^2 + 2x)^2.\n\nHmm, that seems complicated, but maybe I can find a pattern or a recursive relation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider composing the functions. Let me see.\n\nLet’s denote y = x² + 1. Then, from the first equation, P(y) = Q(x)^2 + 2x.\n\nBut y = x² + 1, so x = sqrt(y - 1). But since x can be positive or negative, maybe that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express Q(x) in terms of P.\n\nFrom the first equation: Q(x)^2 = P(x² + 1) - 2x.\n\nFrom the second equation: Q(x² + 1) = P(x)^2.\n\nSo, substituting x with sqrt(y - 1) in the second equation, but that might not be straightforward.\n\nWait, maybe I can substitute x with something else. Let me think.\n\nSuppose I take the first equation: P(x² + 1) = Q(x)^2 + 2x.\n\nIf I replace x with sqrt(t - 1), assuming t >= 1, then P(t) = Q(sqrt(t - 1))^2 + 2*sqrt(t - 1).\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the degrees again. Suppose P and Q are of degree m. Then, from the first equation, P(x² + 1) is degree 2m, and Q(x)^2 is degree 2m as well. So, the leading terms must match.\n\nLet’s denote the leading term of P as a_m x^m and Q as b_n x^n. Since m = n, let's say m = n = k.\n\nThen, the leading term of P(x² + 1) is a_k (x²)^k = a_k x^{2k}.\n\nThe leading term of Q(x)^2 is (b_k x^k)^2 = b_k² x^{2k}.\n\nSo, equating leading terms: a_k = b_k².\n\nSimilarly, from the second equation: Q(x² + 1) has leading term b_k (x²)^k = b_k x^{2k}, and P(x)^2 has leading term (a_k x^k)^2 = a_k² x^{2k}. So, equating leading terms: b_k = a_k².\n\nBut from the first equation, a_k = b_k². So, substituting, we have b_k = (b_k²)² = b_k^4.\n\nSo, b_k^4 - b_k = 0 => b_k(b_k^3 - 1) = 0 => b_k = 0 or b_k^3 = 1.\n\nIf b_k = 0, then a_k = 0, but then P and Q would be zero polynomials, but let's check if that works.\n\nIf P(x) = 0 and Q(x) = 0, then first equation: 0 = 0 + 2x => 0 = 2x, which is not true for all x. So, b_k cannot be 0.\n\nThus, b_k^3 = 1 => b_k = 1 (since we are dealing with real coefficients, the only real cube root of 1 is 1). So, b_k = 1, then a_k = b_k² = 1.\n\nSo, the leading coefficients of P and Q are both 1.\n\nSo, P and Q are monic polynomials of degree k.\n\nNow, let's think about the next term. Let's suppose P(x) = x^k + a x^{k-1} + ... and Q(x) = x^k + b x^{k-1} + ...\n\nLet me try to compute the coefficients step by step.\n\nFrom the first equation: P(x² + 1) = Q(x)^2 + 2x.\n\nLet me expand both sides.\n\nLeft side: P(x² + 1) = (x² + 1)^k + a (x² + 1)^{k-1} + ... \n\nRight side: Q(x)^2 + 2x = (x^k + b x^{k-1} + ...)^2 + 2x = x^{2k} + 2b x^{2k -1} + ... + 2x.\n\nSimilarly, the leading term on the left is x^{2k}, same as the right. The next term on the left is k x^{2k - 2} (from (x² + 1)^k) plus a x^{2k - 2} (from a (x² + 1)^{k-1}).\n\nWait, actually, let me compute the expansion more carefully.\n\nWait, (x² + 1)^k = x^{2k} + k x^{2k - 2} + ... So, the coefficient of x^{2k - 2} is k.\n\nSimilarly, a (x² + 1)^{k - 1} = a x^{2k - 2} + ... So, the coefficient of x^{2k - 2} is a.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of x^{2k - 2} in P(x² + 1) is k + a.\n\nOn the right side, Q(x)^2 + 2x: the coefficient of x^{2k} is 1, as before. The coefficient of x^{2k -1} is 2b, and the coefficient of x^{2k - 2} is (b² + something). Wait, actually, let me think.\n\nWait, Q(x)^2 = (x^k + b x^{k -1} + ...)^2 = x^{2k} + 2b x^{2k -1} + (b² + 2c) x^{2k - 2} + ..., where c is the next coefficient in Q(x). But since we are only considering up to x^{2k - 2}, maybe I can ignore higher terms.\n\nBut actually, in the right side, the term 2x is only contributing to x^1, so for x^{2k - 2}, it's only from Q(x)^2.\n\nSo, the coefficient of x^{2k - 2} in Q(x)^2 is 2b * coefficient of x^{k -1} in Q(x) times coefficient of x^{k -1} in Q(x), but wait, no.\n\nWait, actually, when you square Q(x) = x^k + b x^{k -1} + ..., the coefficient of x^{2k - 2} comes from two sources:\n\n1. The product of the x^{k -1} term with itself: b * b = b².\n2. The product of the x^{k} term with the x^{k - 2} term, but since Q(x) only has up to x^{k -1} in the expansion we're considering, maybe that term is zero.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the square, the coefficient of x^{2k - 2} is 2 * (coefficient of x", "answer": "Mamy \\(2x + Q(x)^2 = P(x^2 + 1) = P((-x)^2 + 1) = Q((-x)^2 - 2x\\),  \nzatem \\(4x = Q(-x)^2 - Q(x)^2 = Q(x)(Q(-x) - Q(x))\\).  \nWynika stąd, że jeden z wielomianów \\(Q(-x) - Q(x), Q(-x) + Q(x)\\) jest stopnia \\(0\\), a drugi — stopnia \\(1\\).

", "response": "Okay, so I have this problem about a game played on an n-sided regular polygon, where n is greater than 3. Two players take turns placing their pawns on the vertices. The rule is that you can't place a pawn on a vertex that's adjacent to an opponent's pawn. The player who can't make a move loses. I need to figure out, depending on whether n is even or odd, whether the first player has a winning strategy or if the second player does.\n\nHmm, let me start by understanding the game mechanics. It's a two-player game with perfect information, so it's a combinatorial game. The key here is the restriction on placing pawns: you can't place a pawn adjacent to the opponent's pawn. So each move potentially blocks some vertices for the opponent.\n\nLet me think about small values of n to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nStarting with n=4, a square. The first player places a pawn on any vertex. Then the second player can't place on the adjacent vertices, so they have two choices left. Wait, in a square, each vertex has two adjacent vertices. So if the first player places on vertex 1, the second player can't place on 2 or 4. So the second player can place on vertex 3. Now, the first player can't place on 2 or 4 because of the second player's pawn on 3. But wait, the first player already has a pawn on 1, so the remaining vertices are 2 and 4, but they are adjacent to 1. So the first player can't place anywhere. So the first player loses? Wait, that can't be right because the second player just placed on 3, which is opposite to 1. So after that, the first player can't place on 2 or 4 because they are adjacent to 1, but 3 is already taken. So the first player can't move and loses. So for n=4, the second player can win.\n\nWait, but maybe the first player can choose a different strategy. If the first player places on 1, the second player places on 3. Then the first player can't move. Alternatively, if the first player places on 1, the second player could place on 2, but then the first player can place on 4, because it's not adjacent to 2. Wait, no, because 4 is adjacent to 1, which is the first player's pawn. So the first player can't place on 4 because it's adjacent to their own pawn? Wait, no, the rule is you can't place on a vertex adjacent to the opponent's pawn. So if the second player places on 2, then the first player can place on 4 because 4 is adjacent to 1 (their own pawn), but the rule is about the opponent's pawn. So the first player can place on 4 because it's not adjacent to the second player's pawn on 2. So after the second player places on 2, the first player can place on 4. Then the second player can't place anywhere because all vertices are either occupied or adjacent to the first player's pawns. So in this case, the first player wins.\n\nWait, so depending on the second player's move, the outcome changes. So maybe the second player can choose the optimal move. If the second player places on 3, the first player loses. If the second player places on 2, the first player can win. So the second player would choose the move that makes them win, which is placing on 3. So for n=4, the second player can win.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me visualize the square. If the first player places on 1, the second player can place on 3, which is the opposite vertex. Then the first player can't place on 2 or 4 because they are adjacent to 1, and 3 is already taken. So the first player loses. So for n=4, second player wins.\n\nNow, n=5, a pentagon. The first player places on 1. The second player can't place on 2 or 5. So they have vertices 3 and 4 available. Suppose the second player places on 3. Now, the first player can't place on 2 or 4 (adjacent to 3). So the first player can place on 5, but 5 is adjacent to 1, which is their own pawn. Wait, no, the rule is about the opponent's pawn. So the first player can place on 5 because it's not adjacent to the second player's pawn on 3. So first player places on 5. Now, the second player can't place on 4 or 1 (adjacent to 5). So the second player can place on 2, but 2 is adjacent to 1, which is the first player's pawn. Wait, no, the second player can place on 2 because it's not adjacent to their own pawn on 3. Wait, 2 is adjacent to 1, which is the first player's pawn, but the rule is you can't place adjacent to the opponent's pawn. So the second player can't place on 2 because it's adjacent to the first player's pawn on 1. Similarly, they can't place on 4 because it's adjacent to 3. So the second player can't move and loses. So the first player wins.\n\nWait, but maybe the second player could have placed on 4 instead of 3. Let's see. First player on 1, second player on 4. Then the first player can't place on 3 or 5 (adjacent to 4). So the first player can place on 2, which is not adjacent to 4. Then the second player can't place on 3 or 5 (adjacent to 2). So the second player can't move and loses. So regardless of where the second player places, the first player can win. So for n=5, the first player can win.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me try another approach. Maybe the parity of n matters. For even n, the second player can mirror the first player's moves, but for odd n, the first player can take the center or something. Wait, but in a polygon, there's no center vertex. Hmm.\n\nWait, in n=4, the second player can mirror the first player's move across the center, placing on the opposite vertex. That way, the first player is always forced into a position where they can't move. But in n=5, there's no exact opposite vertex, so mirroring doesn't work as neatly. So maybe for even n, the second player can mirror and win, while for odd n, the first player can win.\n\nLet me test n=6, a hexagon. First player places on 1. Second player can place on 4, the opposite vertex. Now, the first player can't place on 2 or 6 (adjacent to 1). So they have to place on 3 or 5. Suppose they place on 3. Then the second player can place on 5, because it's opposite to 3? Wait, no, in a hexagon, the opposite of 3 is 6, but 6 is adjacent to 1. Wait, maybe the second player can place on 5, which is adjacent to 4? No, 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6. Wait, if the first player placed on 3, the second player can place on 5, which is not adjacent to 3. Then the first player can't place on 2 or 4 (adjacent to 3 and 5). So the first player can place on 6, but 6 is adjacent to 1, which is their own pawn. Wait, no, the rule is about the opponent's pawn. So the first player can place on 6 because it's not adjacent to the second player's pawns on 4 and 5. Wait, 6 is adjacent to 5, which is the second player's pawn. So the first player can't place on 6. So the first player can't move and loses. So in this case, the second player wins.\n\nWait, but maybe the first player could have placed on 5 instead of 3. Let's see. First player on 1, second on 4. First player places on 5. Then the second player can place on 3, which is opposite to 5? Wait, in a hexagon, 3 is opposite to 6, not 5. Hmm, maybe the second player can place on 3, which is not adjacent to 5. Then the first player can't place on 2 or 6 (adjacent to 1 and 5). So the first player can place on 2, but 2 is adjacent to 1, which is their own pawn. Wait, no, the rule is about the opponent's pawn. So the first player can place on 2 because it's not adjacent to the second player's pawns on 4 and 3. Wait, 2 is adjacent to 3, which is the second player's pawn. So the first player can't place on 2. Similarly, 6 is adjacent to 5, which is the first player's pawn, but the rule is about the opponent's pawn. So 6 is adjacent to 5, which is the first player's pawn, but the second player's pawn is on 4 and 3. So 6 is not adjacent to 4 or 3, so the first player can place on 6. Then the second player can't place anywhere because all vertices are either occupied or adjacent to the first player's pawns. So the second player loses.\n\nWait, so depending on where the first player places after the second player's mirroring, the outcome changes. So maybe the second player can't always win by mirroring. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key is whether n is even or odd. For even n, the second player can mirror the first player's moves, ensuring that they always have a move. For odd n, the first player can take a central position or something, but in a polygon, there's no central vertex. Wait, but in odd polygons, the mirroring doesn't work because there's no exact opposite vertex. So maybe for even n, the second player can mirror and win, while for odd n, the first player can win.\n\nLet me test n=3, but the problem states n>3, so n=4 is the first case. For n=4, second player wins. For n=5, first player wins. For n=6, if the second player mirrors, they can win. Wait, but in my earlier example, the first player could still win if they choose the right moves. Maybe I need a better approach.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to model the game as a graph where each vertex is a possible move, and edges represent adjacency. The game is similar to placing non-adjacent vertices, which is like an independent set. The players are alternately adding vertices to an independent set, with the restriction that each new vertex must not be adjacent to any of the opponent's vertices.\n\nWait, but in this game, the restriction is only about the opponent's pawns, not your own. So you can place on a vertex adjacent to your own pawns, just not the opponent's. So it's a bit different from the standard independent set game.\n\nLet me think about the maximum independent set for a polygon. For a cycle graph C_n, the maximum independent set size is floor(n/2). So for even n, it's n/2, for odd n, it's (n-1)/2.\n\nBut in this game, players are placing pawns alternately, with the restriction that each new pawn can't be adjacent to the opponent's pawns. So it's similar to a game where each player is trying to build their own independent set, but the restriction is only on the opponent's pawns.\n\nWait, maybe the game can be modeled as a bipartite graph. For a cycle graph, which is bipartite when n is even, but not when n is odd. So for even n, the graph is bipartite, and the two partitions are the two sets of vertices that are opposite each other. So if the second player mirrors the first player's moves in the opposite partition, they can always respond, leading to the first player running out of moves first.\n\nFor example, in n=4, the two partitions are {1,3} and {2,4}. If the first player places on 1, the second player places on 3. Then the first player can't place on 2 or 4 because they are adjacent to 1, and 3 is already taken. So the first player loses.\n\nSimilarly, in n=6, the partitions are {1,3,5} and {2,4,6}. If the first player places on 1, the second player places on 3. Then the first player can place on 5, and the second player places on 4, etc. Wait, but in this case, the second player can mirror each move, leading to the first player running out of moves first.\n\nBut for odd n, like n=5, the graph isn't bipartite. The partitions would be {1,3,5} and {2,4}, but they aren't equal in size. So the first player can take a vertex, and the second player can't mirror perfectly, leading to the first player having an advantage.\n\nWait, let me test n=5 again. First player places on 1. Second player can place on 3. Then first player can place on 5, which is not adjacent to 3. Then the second player can't place on 2 or 4 because they are adjacent to 1 and 5. So the second player loses. Alternatively, if the second player places on 4 instead of 3, the first player can place on 2, and the second player can't move. So in both cases, the first player wins.\n\nSimilarly, for n=7, the first player can place on 1, second on 3, first on 5, second on 7, first on 2, and then the second player can't move. Wait, but n=7 has 7 vertices. Let me see:\n\n1. Player 1 places on 1.\n2. Player 2 places on 3.\n3. Player 1 places on 5.\n4. Player 2 places on 7.\n5. Player 1 places on 2 (since it's not adjacent to 3,5,7).\n6. Now, Player 2 can't place on 4 (adjacent to 3 and 5), 6 (adjacent to 5 and 7), or 1 (adjacent to 2). So Player 2 loses.\n\nSo for n=7, the first player wins.\n\nPutting this together, it seems that for even n, the second player can mirror the first player's moves and win, while for odd n, the first player can win by taking the central position or something similar, but in the polygon, it's more about the inability of the second player to mirror perfectly.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that if n is even, the second player can win by mirroring, and if n is", "answer": "Załóżmy, że pierwszym graczem jest Ewa, a drugim — Jan. Wykażemy, że jeśli liczba n jest parzysta, to strategię wygrywającą ma Jan, a jeśli liczba n jest nieparzysta — Ewa. Zacznijmy od pierwszego przypadku.

Let me test that assumption. Suppose \\(x_1 = x_2 = \\dots = x_n = k\\). Then each equation becomes:\n\n\\(2k^3 + 4 = k^2(k + 3)\\).\n\nLet me simplify this equation:\n\n\\(2k^3 + 4 = k^3 + 3k^2\\).\n\nSubtract \\(k^3 + 3k^2\\) from both sides:\n\n\\(2k^3 + 4 - k^3 - 3k^2 = 0\\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\(k^3 - 3k^2 + 4 = 0\\).\n\nSo, I need to solve \\(k^3 - 3k^2 + 4 = 0\\). Let me try to factor this cubic equation. Maybe I can find rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are factors of 4 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±4.\n\nLet me test k=1: \\(1 - 3 + 4 = 2 ≠ 0\\).\n\nk= -1: \\(-1 - 3 + 4 = 0\\). Oh, k=-1 is a root!\n\nSo, I can factor out (k + 1):\n\nUsing polynomial division or synthetic division:\n\nDivide \\(k^3 - 3k^2 + 4\\) by (k + 1):\n\n- Coefficients: 1 | -3 | 0 | 4 (Wait, actually, the cubic is \\(k^3 - 3k^2 + 0k + 4\\).)\n\nUsing synthetic division with root -1:\n\n-1 | 1  -3   0    4\n         -1   4  -4\n      1  -4   4    0\n\nSo, the cubic factors as (k + 1)(k^2 - 4k + 4). \n\nNow, factor \\(k^2 - 4k + 4\\): that's a perfect square, (k - 2)^2.\n\nSo, the equation factors as (k + 1)(k - 2)^2 = 0.\n\nThus, the roots are k = -1 and k = 2 (with multiplicity 2).\n\nSo, possible solutions are k = -1 and k = 2.\n\nTherefore, if all variables are equal, they can be either -1 or 2.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if these solutions satisfy the original equations.\n\nFirst, let's check k = 2:\n\nPlug into the equation: 2*(2)^3 + 4 = 2^2*(2 + 3)\n\nLeft side: 2*8 + 4 = 16 + 4 = 20\n\nRight side: 4*(5) = 20\n\nSo, 20 = 20, which works.\n\nNow, check k = -1:\n\nLeft side: 2*(-1)^3 + 4 = 2*(-1) + 4 = -2 + 4 = 2\n\nRight side: (-1)^2*(-1 + 3) = 1*(2) = 2\n\nSo, 2 = 2, which also works.\n\nSo, both k = 2 and k = -1 are solutions when all variables are equal.\n\nBut wait, the problem is a system of n equations with n variables. So, is it possible that not all variables are equal? Maybe there are other solutions where variables are different.\n\nBut given the cyclic nature, it's often the case that symmetric solutions are the only ones, especially if the system is symmetric. But let me think.\n\nSuppose that not all variables are equal. Let's say, for example, that x1 ≠ x2. Then, from the first equation:\n\n2x1^3 + 4 = x1^2(x2 + 3)\n\nSimilarly, from the second equation:\n\n2x2^3 + 4 = x2^2(x3 + 3)\n\nAnd so on, until the last equation loops back to x1.\n\nThis seems like a cyclic dependency. Maybe I can express each variable in terms of the next one.\n\nLet me try to express x_{i+1} in terms of x_i.\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\n2x1^3 + 4 = x1^2(x2 + 3)\n\nDivide both sides by x1^2 (assuming x1 ≠ 0):\n\n2x1 + 4/x1^2 = x2 + 3\n\nSo, x2 = 2x1 + 4/x1^2 - 3\n\nSimilarly, from the second equation:\n\nx3 = 2x2 + 4/x2^2 - 3\n\nAnd so on, until:\n\nx1 = 2xn + 4/xn^2 - 3\n\nSo, if I substitute each equation into the next, I might get a function that maps x1 to itself after n steps.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe I can consider the function f(t) = 2t + 4/t^2 - 3.\n\nThen, the system implies that x_{i+1} = f(x_i), and since it's cyclic, x1 = f(xn) = f(f(...f(x1)...)) n times.\n\nSo, x1 is a fixed point after n iterations of f.\n\nBut solving f^n(x1) = x1 is non-trivial. However, if all variables are equal, then x1 = f(x1), so x1 is a fixed point of f.\n\nWe already found the fixed points: x = 2 and x = -1.\n\nBut are there other fixed points? Let's check.\n\nSet f(t) = t:\n\n2t + 4/t^2 - 3 = t\n\nSubtract t:\n\nt + 4/t^2 - 3 = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by t^2:\n\nt^3 + 4 - 3t^2 = 0\n\nWhich is the same equation as before: t^3 - 3t^2 + 4 = 0, which factors as (t + 1)(t - 2)^2 = 0.\n\nSo, the only fixed points are t = -1 and t = 2.\n\nTherefore, if the system has a solution where all variables are equal, they must be either -1 or 2.\n\nBut could there be solutions where variables are not all equal? For example, in a 2-variable system, maybe x1 ≠ x2 but still satisfy the equations.\n\nLet me test with n=2.\n\nCase n=2:\n\nEquations:\n\n2x1^3 + 4 = x1^2(x2 + 3)\n\n2x2^3 + 4 = x2^2(x1 + 3)\n\nSuppose x1 ≠ x2.\n\nLet me try to solve this system.\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\n2x1^3 + 4 = x1^2 x2 + 3x1^2\n\nRearranged:\n\nx1^2 x2 = 2x1^3 + 4 - 3x1^2\n\nSo, x2 = (2x1^3 + 4 - 3x1^2)/x1^2 = 2x1 + 4/x1^2 - 3\n\nSimilarly, from the second equation:\n\nx1 = 2x2 + 4/x2^2 - 3\n\nSo, substituting x2 from the first equation into the second:\n\nx1 = 2*(2x1 + 4/x1^2 - 3) + 4/( (2x1 + 4/x1^2 - 3)^2 ) - 3\n\nThis looks messy, but let's see if we can find a solution where x1 ≠ x2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe x1 and x2 are roots of the same cubic equation.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to assume that x1 = x2, which gives us the solutions we already found: 2 and -1.\n\nBut let's see if there are other solutions.\n\nSuppose x1 = 2, then x2 = 2*(2) + 4/(2)^2 - 3 = 4 + 1 - 3 = 2. So, consistent.\n\nIf x1 = -1, x2 = 2*(-1) + 4/(-1)^2 - 3 = -2 + 4 - 3 = -1. Also consistent.\n\nWhat if x1 = something else? Let's try x1 = 1.\n\nThen x2 = 2*1 + 4/1 - 3 = 2 + 4 - 3 = 3.\n\nThen plug x2=3 into the second equation:\n\nx1 = 2*3 + 4/9 - 3 = 6 + 4/9 - 3 = 3 + 4/9 ≈ 3.444...\n\nBut we started with x1=1, which is not equal to 3.444, so this doesn't work.\n\nWhat about x1=0? Wait, x1=0 would cause division by zero in the expression for x2, so x1 can't be zero.\n\nWhat about x1= -2?\n\nx2 = 2*(-2) + 4/(-2)^2 - 3 = -4 + 1 - 3 = -6\n\nThen x1 = 2*(-6) + 4/(-6)^2 - 3 = -12 + 4/36 - 3 ≈ -15 + 0.111 ≈ -14.888...\n\nNot equal to -2, so no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe x1= something else. Let me try x1= sqrt(2). Hmm, but this might not lead anywhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the only solutions are the symmetric ones.\n\nGiven that for n=2, the only solutions are x1=x2=2 and x1=x2=-1, maybe for general n, the only solutions are all variables equal to 2 or -1.\n\nBut wait, in the cubic equation, we have a double root at 2, so maybe 2 is a more stable solution.\n\nBut let's think about the function f(t) = 2t + 4/t^2 - 3.\n\nIf we iterate f starting from some t, does it converge to 2 or -1?\n\nBut perhaps that's beyond the scope here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe all variables must be equal because of the cyclic nature.\n\nSuppose that x1 = x2 = ... = xn = k, then we have the solutions k=2 and k=-1.\n\nBut could there be a solution where variables alternate between 2 and -1? For example, in n=2, x1=2, x2=-1, but then check if that works.\n\nLet me test n=2 with x1=2, x2=-1.\n\nFirst equation: 2*(2)^3 +4 = 2^2*(-1 +3)\n\nLeft: 16 +4=20\n\nRight:4*(2)=8\n\n20≠8, so that doesn't work.\n\nSimilarly, x1=-1, x2=2:\n\nFirst equation: 2*(-1)^3 +4 = (-1)^2*(2 +3)\n\nLeft: -2 +4=2\n\nRight:1*5=5\n\n2≠5, so no.\n\nSo, alternating doesn't work.\n\nWhat about other combinations? Maybe some variables are 2 and others are -1, but not in a pattern.\n\nBut given the cyclic nature, it's likely that all variables must be equal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all variables are 2 or all are -1.\n\nBut let's check for n=3.\n\nSuppose n=3, and x1=2, x2=2, x3=2. Then each equation is satisfied.\n\nSimilarly, x1=-1, x2=-1, x3=-1 also works.\n\nBut what if x1=2, x2=2, x3=-1.\n\nCheck first equation: 2*8 +4= 16+4=20. RHS:4*(2 +3)=20. Good.\n\nSecond equation: 2*8 +4=20. RHS:4*(-1 +3)=8. 20≠8. So, doesn't work.\n\nSimilarly, if x3=2, then x1 must be 2, so all must be 2.\n\nSame with -1.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the only solutions are all variables equal to 2 or all equal to -1.\n\nHence, for the general case, the solutions are x1=x2=...=xn=2 or x1=x2=...=xn=-1.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there could be other solutions where variables are not all equal but still satisfy the system.\n\nSuppose n=3, and x1=2, x2=2, x3=2: works.\n\nx1=-1, x2=-1, x3=-1: works.\n\nWhat if x1=2, x2= something else, x3= something else.\n\nFrom first equation: x2 = 2x1 +4/x1^2 -3 = 4 +1 -3=2.\n\nSo, x2=2.\n\nThen from second equation: x3=2x2 +4/x2^2 -3=4 +1 -3=2.\n\nThen from third equation: x1=2x3 +4/x3^2 -3=4 +1 -3=2.\n\nSo, x1=2, consistent.\n\nSimilarly, if x1=-1, then x2=2*(-1)+4/1 -3= -2 +4 -3=-1.\n\nThen x3=2*(-1)+4/1 -3=-1.\n\nAnd x1=2*(-1)+4/1 -3=-1.\n\nConsistent.\n\nSo, in n=3, even if I try to set x1=2, the rest must be 2. Similarly for -1.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the only solutions are all variables equal to 2 or all equal to -1.\n\nHence, for the general case, the solutions are x1=x2=...=xn=2 or x1", "answer": "Z układu równań wynika od razu, że \\(x_i \\neq 0\\) dla \\(i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n\\).

The function has two conditions: first, \\( f(0) > 0 \\), and second, for every integer \\( k \\), the minimum of \\( f(k - l) + f(l) \\) over all integers \\( l \\) is equal to \\( f(k) \\). Hmm, interesting.\n\nLet me try to unpack this. The function \\( f \\) is defined on all integers, and it's non-negative. So, \\( f(k) \\) is a non-negative integer for each \\( k \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\). The first condition is straightforward: \\( f(0) \\) must be a positive integer. The second condition is a bit more complex. For each \\( k \\), the minimum value of \\( f(k - l) + f(l) \\) as \\( l \\) ranges over all integers must be exactly \\( f(k) \\).\n\nSo, for each \\( k \\), \\( f(k) \\) is the minimum of \\( f(k - l) + f(l) \\) over all \\( l \\). That sounds a lot like the definition of a subadditive function, but with a twist because it's over all integers \\( l \\), not just non-negative ones. Wait, actually, in the case of subadditive functions, we usually have \\( f(a + b) \\leq f(a) + f(b) \\), but here it's a bit different because we're taking the minimum over all possible splits \\( l \\) and \\( k - l \\).\n\nLet me think about what this implies. If for each \\( k \\), \\( f(k) \\) is the minimum of \\( f(k - l) + f(l) \\), then this suggests that \\( f(k) \\) is the smallest possible sum of two values of \\( f \\) that add up to \\( k \\). So, in a way, \\( f \\) is being defined recursively based on its values at other points.\n\nGiven that \\( f(0) > 0 \\), let's consider \\( k = 0 \\). For \\( k = 0 \\), the minimum of \\( f(0 - l) + f(l) \\) over all \\( l \\) must be \\( f(0) \\). So, \\( f(0) \\) is the minimum of \\( f(-l) + f(l) \\) for all \\( l \\). But since \\( f \\) is non-negative, the minimum of these sums is at least \\( 2f(0) \\) if \\( l = 0 \\), because \\( f(0) + f(0) = 2f(0) \\). But wait, the minimum is supposed to be \\( f(0) \\). So, \\( f(0) \\leq 2f(0) \\), which is always true, but we need the minimum to be exactly \\( f(0) \\). That means there must exist some \\( l \\) such that \\( f(-l) + f(l) = f(0) \\).\n\nBut \\( f(-l) \\) and \\( f(l) \\) are both non-negative integers. So, their sum is at least 0, but since \\( f(0) > 0 \\), the sum must be at least 1. However, the minimum is \\( f(0) \\), so there must be some \\( l \\) where \\( f(-l) + f(l) = f(0) \\). Let's consider \\( l = 0 \\). Then, \\( f(0) + f(0) = 2f(0) \\), which is greater than \\( f(0) \\) since \\( f(0) > 0 \\). So, \\( l \\) can't be 0. Therefore, there must be some non-zero \\( l \\) such that \\( f(-l) + f(l) = f(0) \\).\n\nLet me denote \\( l = m \\), so \\( f(-m) + f(m) = f(0) \\). Since \\( f \\) is non-negative, both \\( f(m) \\) and \\( f(-m) \\) are non-negative integers. Their sum is \\( f(0) \\), which is a positive integer. So, the possibilities are that one of them is 0 and the other is \\( f(0) \\), or both are positive integers adding up to \\( f(0) \\).\n\nBut wait, if \\( f(m) = 0 \\) for some \\( m \\neq 0 \\), then let's see what that implies. Suppose \\( f(m) = 0 \\). Then, for \\( k = m \\), the minimum of \\( f(m - l) + f(l) \\) over all \\( l \\) must be \\( f(m) = 0 \\). So, there exists some \\( l \\) such that \\( f(m - l) + f(l) = 0 \\). Since \\( f \\) is non-negative, this implies \\( f(m - l) = 0 \\) and \\( f(l) = 0 \\). So, both \\( f(m - l) \\) and \\( f(l) \\) must be zero.\n\nBut if \\( f(l) = 0 \\), then for \\( k = l \\), the minimum of \\( f(l - l') + f(l') \\) over all \\( l' \\) must be \\( f(l) = 0 \\). So, there exists some \\( l' \\) such that \\( f(l - l') + f(l') = 0 \\), which again implies both are zero. This seems to suggest that if \\( f(m) = 0 \\) for some \\( m \\neq 0 \\), then \\( f \\) must be zero at infinitely many points, potentially leading to \\( f(k) = 0 \\) for all \\( k \\), which contradicts \\( f(0) > 0 \\).\n\nTherefore, perhaps \\( f(m) \\) and \\( f(-m) \\) are both positive integers adding up to \\( f(0) \\). Let's say \\( f(m) = a \\) and \\( f(-m) = b \\), where \\( a + b = f(0) \\), and \\( a, b \\geq 1 \\). Then, for \\( k = m \\), the minimum of \\( f(m - l) + f(l) \\) must be \\( a \\). So, there must exist some \\( l \\) such that \\( f(m - l) + f(l) = a \\). Similarly, for \\( k = -m \\), the minimum must be \\( b \\).\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I should consider specific cases. Let's try to see if such a function exists. Let's suppose \\( f(k) = c \\) for all \\( k \\), where \\( c \\) is a constant. Then, \\( f(0) = c > 0 \\). For any \\( k \\), the minimum of \\( f(k - l) + f(l) = c + c = 2c \\). But this must equal \\( f(k) = c \\). So, \\( 2c = c \\), which implies \\( c = 0 \\). But \\( f(0) > 0 \\), so this is impossible. Therefore, a constant function won't work.\n\nWhat if \\( f(k) \\) is zero for all \\( k \\neq 0 \\) and \\( f(0) = 1 \\)? Then, for any \\( k \\neq 0 \\), the minimum of \\( f(k - l) + f(l) \\) would be the minimum of 0 + 0 = 0, since we can choose \\( l = k \\) or \\( l = 0 \\). But \\( f(k) = 0 \\), so the minimum is 0, which equals \\( f(k) \\). For \\( k = 0 \\), the minimum is \\( f(-l) + f(l) \\). If \\( l \\neq 0 \\), then \\( f(-l) + f(l) = 0 + 0 = 0 \\). But \\( f(0) = 1 \\), so the minimum is 0, which is less than \\( f(0) = 1 \\). This violates the condition because the minimum should be equal to \\( f(0) \\). So, this function doesn't work either.\n\nHmm, maybe another approach. Let's think about the function \\( f(k) \\) as being related to the absolute value function. Suppose \\( f(k) = |k| \\). Then, \\( f(0) = 0 \\), which doesn't satisfy \\( f(0) > 0 \\). So, maybe \\( f(k) = |k| + c \\) where \\( c \\) is a constant. Then, \\( f(0) = c > 0 \\). For any \\( k \\), the minimum of \\( f(k - l) + f(l) \\) would be the minimum of \\( |k - l| + |l| + 2c \\). The minimum of \\( |k - l| + |l| \\) is \\( |k| \\), so the minimum of \\( f(k - l) + f(l) \\) is \\( |k| + 2c \\). But \\( f(k) = |k| + c \\). So, we need \\( |k| + 2c = |k| + c \\), which implies \\( c = 0 \\). But \\( c > 0 \\), so this doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe \\( f(k) \\) is a constant function except at 0. For example, \\( f(0) = 1 \\) and \\( f(k) = 0 \\) for \\( k \\neq 0 \\). But as I saw earlier, this doesn't work because for \\( k = 0 \\), the minimum is 0, which is less than \\( f(0) = 1 \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe \\( f(k) \\) is 1 for all \\( k \\). Then, \\( f(0) = 1 > 0 \\). For any \\( k \\), the minimum of \\( f(k - l) + f(l) = 1 + 1 = 2 \\). But \\( f(k) = 1 \\), so 2 ≠ 1. Doesn't work.\n\nWhat if \\( f(k) \\) is 1 for \\( k = 0 \\) and 2 for all other \\( k \\). Then, \\( f(0) = 1 \\). For \\( k = 0 \\), the minimum of \\( f(-l) + f(l) \\). If \\( l = 0 \\), it's 1 + 1 = 2. If \\( l \\neq 0 \\), it's 2 + 2 = 4. So, the minimum is 2, which should equal \\( f(0) = 1 \\). Doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \\( f(k) \\) is 1 for \\( k = 0 \\) and 1 for all other \\( k \\). Then, same as before, the minimum for \\( k = 0 \\) is 2, which is not equal to 1.\n\nWait, maybe \\( f(k) \\) is 1 for \\( k = 0 \\) and 0 for all other \\( k \\). But then, for \\( k = 0 \\), the minimum is 0, which is less than 1. So, no.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe I need to think differently. Let's consider the condition for \\( k = 1 \\). The minimum of \\( f(1 - l) + f(l) \\) over all \\( l \\) must be \\( f(1) \\). Let's denote \\( l = 0 \\), then \\( f(1) + f(0) \\). If \\( l = 1 \\), then \\( f(0) + f(1) \\). If \\( l = 2 \\), then \\( f(-1) + f(2) \\), and so on. So, the minimum of all these must be \\( f(1) \\).\n\nSimilarly, for \\( k = -1 \\), the minimum of \\( f(-1 - l) + f(l) \\) must be \\( f(-1) \\).\n\nThis seems to suggest that \\( f(k) \\) must be less than or equal to \\( f(k - l) + f(l) \\) for all \\( l \\), but the minimum is exactly \\( f(k) \\). So, for each \\( k \\), there exists some \\( l \\) such that \\( f(k) = f(k - l) + f(l) \\).\n\nThis is similar to the concept of a function being additive over some partition. Maybe \\( f \\) is additive in some way. But since it's over all integers, it's not straightforward.\n\nWait, if \\( f(k) = f(k - l) + f(l) \\) for some \\( l \\), then perhaps \\( f \\) is linear? But \\( f \\) is defined on integers, so linearity would imply \\( f(k) = c|k| \\) or something, but we saw that doesn't work because of the constant term.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \\( f(k) \\) is periodic. Suppose \\( f(k) = c \\) for all \\( k \\), but we saw that doesn't work unless \\( c = 0 \\), which contradicts \\( f(0) > 0 \\).\n\nWait, another thought. If \\( f(k) \\) is the same for all \\( k \\), except \\( f(0) \\) is different, but that didn't work earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \\( f(k) \\) is 1 for all \\( k \\). But as before, the minimum for \\( k = 0 \\) would be 2, which is not equal to 1.\n\nWait, perhaps \\( f(k) \\) is 1 for \\( k = 0 \\) and 1 for \\( k = 1 \\), and 0 otherwise. Let's test this.\n\nFor \\( k = 0 \\), the minimum of \\( f(-l) + f(l) \\). If \\( l = 0 \\), it's 1 + 1 = 2. If \\( l = 1 \\), it's 0 + 1 = 1. If \\( l = -1 \\), it's 1 + 0 = 1. For other \\( l \\), it's 0 + 0 = 0. Wait, but \\( f(k) \\) is 0 for \\( |k| \\geq 2 \\). So, for \\( l = 2 \\), \\( f(-2) + f(2) = 0 + 0 = 0 \\). So, the minimum is 0, which is less than \\( f(0) = 1 \\). So, this doesn't work.\n\nHmm, maybe I need a function where \\( f(k) \\) is non-zero for all \\( k \\). Let's suppose \\( f(k) = 1 \\) for all \\( k \\). Then, as before, the minimum for \\( k = 0 \\) is 2, which is not equal to 1. So, no.\n\nWait", "answer": "Udowodnijmy, że takiej funkcji nie ma. Przyjmijmy, że \\( f \\) jest funkcją o podanych własnościach. Niech \\( m \\) będzie jej najmniejszą wartością (istnieje, bo wartościami funkcji są nieujemne liczby całkowite) i niech \\( a \\) będzie liczbą o najmniejszej wartości bezwzględnej, dla której zachodzi równość \\( f(a) = m \\).
