Let $A$ and $B$ be two sets of 100 cards each. We say that $A$ beats $B$ if $f^{-1}(A)$ beats $f^{-1}(B)$, where $f^{-1}(A)$ is the set of all real numbers $x$ such that $f(x)$ is in $A$. It is easy to see that this definition satisfies all the conditions. Conversely, let $R$ be a rule that satisfies all the conditions. Let $A$ and $B$ be two sets of 100 cards each. We say that $A$ beats $B$ if $R(A,B)$ is true. It is easy to see that this definition also satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, there is a one-to-one correspondence between rules that satisfy the conditions and functions $f$ that assign to each real number $x$ the set of cards with $x$ written on them.
