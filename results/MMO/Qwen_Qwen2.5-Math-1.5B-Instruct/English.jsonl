Here, we consider two rules as different if there exist two sets $A$ and $B$ such that $A$ beats $B$ according to one rule, but $B$ beats $A$ according to the other.", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to define a rule that determines the winner based on the relative order of the cards drawn by the two players, while satisfying the given conditions. Let's analyze the conditions step by step.\n\n1. **Condition 1**: The winner only depends on the relative order of the 200 cards. This means that the rule should be based solely on the order of the cards when they are sorted, and not on the actual values of the numbers on the cards.\n\n2. **Condition 2**: If for all $i$, $a_i > b_i$, then $A$ beats $B$. This means that if every card in $A$ is greater than the corresponding card in $B$ when both sets are sorted, then $A$ should win.\n\n3. **Condition 3**: If $A$ beats $B$ and $B$ beats $C$, then $A$ should also beat $C$. This is the transitivity condition, which is a fundamental property of the rule.\n\nGiven these conditions, the only rule that satisfies all of them is the rule where $A$ beats $B$ if and only if the $i$-th smallest card in $A$ is greater than the $i$-th smallest card in $B$ for all $i$ from 1 to 100. This rule is known as the \"sum of the ranks\" rule or the \"sum of the positions\" rule.\n\nTo see why this is the only rule, consider that any other rule would either violate the transitivity condition or the first condition. For example, if we had a rule that considered the sum of the values of the cards in each set, it would not necessarily satisfy the first condition because the values of the cards are not specified. Similarly, if we had a rule that considered the number of cards in $A$ that are greater than the corresponding cards in $B$, it would not necessarily satisfy the first condition because it would depend on the actual values of the cards.\n\nTherefore, the only rule that satisfies all the conditions is the rule where $A$ beats $B$ if and only if the $i$-th smallest card in $A$ is greater than the $i$-th smallest card in $B$ for all $i$ from 1 to 100. This rule is unique.\n\nThus, the number of ways to define such a rule is \\(\\boxed{1}\\).", "answer": "100"}
