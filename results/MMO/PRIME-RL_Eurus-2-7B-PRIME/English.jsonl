The rule must satisfy three conditions: it depends only on the relative order of the cards, it correctly determines the winner based on the relative order of corresponding cards in the sets, and it is transitive.\n\n[ADVANCE]\n\nTo satisfy the conditions, we can consider a rule that involves a fixed reference set.

The goat starts at the origin $(0,0)$ and makes moves in a sequence of up, right, down, left, and repeats, with the distance of each move increasing by 1 unit each time.\n\n[ADVANCE]\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to break down the moves into their respective components and calculate the total distance traveled in each direction. The moves can be grouped into sets of 4, with each set consisting of a move in the up, right, down, and left directions.\n\nLet's calculate the total distance traveled after $n$ moves. The distance traveled in each move is $1, 2, 3, \\ldots, n$. The sum of the first $n$ positive integers is given by the formula $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. We are given that the total distance traveled is 55 units, so we need to find the value of $n$ such that $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 55$.\n\nSolving the equation $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 55$, we get:\n\\[ n(n+1) = 110. \\]\nBy trial and error or solving the quadratic equation, we find that $n = 10$.\n\nNow, we need to determine the position of the goat after 10 moves.
