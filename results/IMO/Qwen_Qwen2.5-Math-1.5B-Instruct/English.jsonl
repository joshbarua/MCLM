", "response": "To solve the problem, we need to understand the properties of the diagonals and the triangles formed in the dissection of the regular 2006-gon \\(P\\).\n\nFirst, let's analyze the nature of the good diagonals and sides. A diagonal of \\(P\\) is called good if its endpoints divide the boundary of \\(P\\) into two parts, each composed of an odd number of sides of \\(P\\). Since \\(P\\) has 2006 sides, any good diagonal will split the polygon into two parts, each with an odd number of sides. This means that the endpoints of a good diagonal must be separated by an even number of sides.\n\nNow, consider the dissection of \\(P\\) into triangles using 2003 diagonals. Each triangle in this dissection will have either two good sides or one good side and two non good sides, or three non good sides. We are interested in the maximum number of isosceles triangles that have two good sides.\n\nIn a regular polygon, an isosceles triangle with two good sides must have its base as a side of the polygon (since the sides of the polygon are also good). This is because the only way to form an isosceles triangle with two good sides is to have the base as a side of the polygon, and the two equal sides will be diagonals that are good.\n\nSince \\(P\\) has 2006 sides, and each side of \\(P\\) can be the base of exactly one isosceles triangle with two good sides, the maximum number of such isosceles triangles is 1003. This is because each isosceles triangle with two good sides uses up one side of the polygon, and since there are 2006 sides, we can form at most 1003 such triangles.\n\nThus, the maximum number of isosceles triangles having two good sides that could appear in such a configuration is \\(\\boxed{1003}\\).", "answer": "1003"}

We need to separate the points such that no region contains both red and blue points. This can be achieved by drawing lines that separate the points of different colors.\n\nA key insight is that each line can separate the plane into two regions. If we draw a line that separates a red point from a blue point, it will create a region containing only red points and another region containing only blue points. To ensure that we can separate all points, we need to draw enough lines to create regions that can accommodate all the points.\n\nThe number of lines required to separate the points can be determined by considering the worst-case scenario, where the points are arranged in such a way that the maximum number of lines is needed. In the worst case, we might have a configuration where the points are arranged in a way that requires the maximum number of lines to separate them.\n\nFor a configuration of \\( n \\) points, the maximum number of lines required to separate them is \\( n-1 \\). This is because each line can separate the plane into two regions, and we need to separate \\( n \\) points into regions where each region contains points of only one color.

However, we need to find the minimum number of lines that are sufficient to separate the points. It turns out that we can use a smaller number of lines to achieve the same result.\n\nBy using a more strategic approach, we can use the fact that we can separate the points using a smaller number of lines. Specifically, we can use the fact that we can separate the points using a number of lines equal to the number of colors minus one. In this case, we have two colors (red and blue), so we need \\( 2 - 1 = 1 \\) line to separate the points.\n\nHowever, this is not sufficient to separate all the points. We need to use a more strategic approach. By using the fact that we can separate the points using a number of lines equal to the number of points minus one, we can achieve the same result. In this case, we have 4027 points, so we need \\( 4027 - 1 = 4026 \\) lines to separate the points.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of lines required to separate the points is \\( 2013 \\). This is because we can separate the points using a number of lines equal to the number of points of the less frequent color minus one.

Then \\( k = m \\). Consider the \\( m \\times m \\) square in the top-left corner of the chessboard. If this square contained a rook, then the rook would be in the first \\( m \\) rows and the first \\( m \\) columns. However, since there are \\( m \\) rooks in each row and each column, and the rooks are placed such that no two rooks are in the same row or column, it is impossible for all \\( m \\) rooks to be in the first \\( m \\) rows and the first \\( m \\) columns. Therefore, there must be a \\( m \\times m \\) square that does not contain any rooks.\n\n2. **Case when \\( n \\) is odd:**\n   Let \\( n = 2m + 1 \\). Then \\( k = m \\).

Therefore, there must be an \\( m \\times m \\) square that does not contain any rooks.\n\nTo show that \\( k = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor + 1 \\) is not always possible, consider the following example:\n- For \\( n = 3 \\), the rooks can be placed in the positions (1,1), (2,2), and (3,3). The largest square that does not contain any rooks is a \\( 1 \\times 1 \\) square, which is not as large as \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{3}{2} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 2 \\).\n\nTherefore, the greatest positive integer \\( k \\) such that for each peaceful configuration of \\( n \\) rooks, there is a \\( k \\times k \\) square which does not contain a rook on any of its \\( k^2 \\) unit squares is \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor \\).\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor}\\).", "answer": "\\lfloor \\sqrt{n - 1} \\rfloor"}

Each company operates \\( k \\) cable cars, and each cable car connects two stations such that the starting station is lower than the finishing station. This means that each company's cable cars form a set of directed edges in a directed graph where each vertex (station) has an入 degree equal to the number of companies' cable cars that start from it and an out degree equal to the number of companies' cable cars that end at it.\n\nFor a company, the maximum number of stations that can be reached from a given station is \\( k \\) (since each cable car connects to a different station). Therefore, the maximum number of stations that can be reached by a company is \\( k+1 \\) (including the starting station).\n\nNow, let's consider the combined effect of both companies. If we combine the directed graphs of both companies, the maximum number of stations that can be reached from a given station is \\( 2k \\) (since each company's cable cars can connect to different stations). However, we need to find the smallest \\( k \\) such that there is at least one station that is reachable by both companies.\n\nTo guarantee that there is at least one station that is reachable by both companies, we need to consider the pigeonhole principle. If \\( k = 1 \\), then each company's cable car connects to a different station, and there is no guarantee that any station is reachable by both companies. If \\( k = 2 \\), then each company's cable cars can connect to up to 2 different stations, and there is still no guarantee that any station is reachable by both companies. However, if \\( k = 3 \\), then each company's cable cars can connect to up to 3 different stations, and there is a guarantee that at least one station is reachable by both companies.\n\nTo see why \\( k = 3 \\) works, consider the following: if \\( k = 3 \\), then each company's cable cars can connect to up to 3 different stations. This means that there are 3 stations that are reachable by both companies. Therefore, the smallest positive integer \\( k \\) for which one can guarantee that there are two stations that are linked by both companies is \\( \\boxed{3} \\).", "answer": "n^2-n+1"}

Let's denote the function by \\( f \\) and consider the inequality for specific values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\nFirst, let's consider the case when \\( x = y \\).

This means that for each \\( x \\in \\mathbb{R}^+ \\), there is exactly one \\( y \\in \\mathbb{R}^+ \\) (namely \\( y = x \\)) that satisfies the inequality.\n\nThus, the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x} \\) is a solution.

A cube is a three-dimensional grid, and we need to find the minimum number of uphill paths that cover all cells.\n\nFirst, let's understand the concept of a valley. A valley is a cell that is adjacent only to cells containing larger numbers. This means that a valley is a local minimum in the cube. An uphill path starts at a valley and moves to adjacent cells with increasing numbers.\n\nTo minimize the number of uphill paths, we should try to maximize the number of cells that can be part of the same path. This can be achieved by arranging the numbers in such a way that there are as few local minima (valles) as possible.
