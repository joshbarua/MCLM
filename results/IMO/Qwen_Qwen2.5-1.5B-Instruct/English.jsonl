Find the maximum number of isosceles triangles having two good sides that could appear in such a configuration. ", "response": "To solve the problem, we need to understand the properties of the regular 2006-gon and the conditions under which a diagonal is called \"good.\" A diagonal is good if its endpoints divide the boundary of the polygon into two parts, each composed of an odd number of sides. This means that a good diagonal connects two vertices that are separated by an odd number of sides.\n\nFirst, let's consider the structure of the 2006-gon. A regular 2006-gon has 2006 sides and 2006 vertices. A diagonal is good if it connects two vertices that are separated by an odd number of sides. This means that a good diagonal connects two vertices that are separated by an odd number of sides, and the sides of the polygon are also good.\n\nNow, let's consider the triangulation of the 2006-gon. A triangulation of a polygon divides it into triangles by drawing diagonals. In this problem, we are given that the 2006-gon has been dissected into 2003 triangles, and no two of these triangles share a common point in the interior of the 2006-gon. This means that each triangle shares at most one side with another triangle.\n\nTo maximize the number of isosceles triangles having two good sides, we need to consider the properties of isosceles triangles. An isosceles triangle has two equal sides, and in a regular polygon, the equal sides are the sides of the polygon itself. Therefore, an isosceles triangle with two good sides must have its equal sides as sides of the polygon, and its base as a diagonal that is good.\n\nIn a regular 2006-gon, the number of good diagonals is equal to the number of sides of the polygon, which is 2006. However, not all of these diagonals are good. A diagonal is good if it connects two vertices that are separated by an odd number of sides. In a regular 2006-gon, the number of good diagonals is equal to the number of sides of the polygon, which is 2006. However, not all of these diagonals are good. A diagonal is good if it connects two vertices that are separated by an odd number of sides. In a regular 2006-gon, the number of good diagonals is equal to the number of sides of the polygon, which is 2006.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of isosceles triangles having two good sides is the number of good diagonals, which is 2006. However, since we are asked to find the maximum number of isosceles triangles having two good sides, and since each isosceles triangle with two good sides must have its equal sides as sides of the polygon, the maximum number of such triangles is the number of sides of the polygon, which is 2006.\n\nThus, the maximum number of isosceles triangles having two good sides that could appear in such a configuration is \\(\\boxed{1003}\\).", "answer": "1003"}

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have a Colombian configuration consisting of 2013 red points and 2014 blue points.\n   - We need to draw lines such that no line passes through any point and no region contains points of both colors.\n   - We need to find the minimum number of lines \\( k \\) that can achieve this.\n\n2. **Key Insight:**\n   - The key insight is that we can use the concept of a \"grid\" to divide the plane into regions. A grid of lines can be used to separate the points into different regions.\n   - For a grid of lines, each line can be thought of as a vertical or horizontal line that divides the plane into two regions.\n\n3. **Counting the Lines:**\n   - To separate 2013 red points and 2014 blue points, we need to ensure that no line passes through any point and no region contains points of both colors.\n   - The minimum number of lines required to separate 2013 red points and 2014 blue points is 2014. This is because we need 2014 lines to separate the 2013 red points from the 2014 blue points, and each line can be either vertical or horizontal.\n\n4. **Verification:**\n   - If we draw 2014 lines, we can separate the points into 2015 regions (2014 vertical lines and 2014 horizontal lines).\n   - Each region will contain either all red points or all blue points, and no line will pass through any point.\n   - No region will contain points of both colors, as each region will contain either all red points or all blue points.\n\nTherefore, the least value of \\( k \\) such that for any Colombian configuration of 4027 points, there is a good arrangement of \\( k \\) lines is \\(\\boxed{2014}\\).", "answer": "2013"}

We have \\( n^2 \\) stations on a slope, and each company operates \\( k \\) cable cars. Each cable car has a starting point and a finishing point, and the starting point is higher than the finishing point. The goal is to find the smallest \\( k \\) such that there are two stations that are linked by both companies.\n\nConsider the following scenario: if \\( k = 1 \\), then each company has only one cable car. In this case, each company can only link one station to another station, but not to any other station. Therefore, it is impossible for two stations to be linked by both companies.\n\nNow, let's consider \\( k = 2 \\). Each company has two cable cars. If we label the stations as \\( S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_{n^2} \\) in increasing order of altitude, then each company's cable cars can link stations in a way that covers all possible pairs of stations. Specifically, each company's cable cars can link \\( S_i \\) to \\( S_{i+k} \\) and \\( S_{i+k+1} \\) for some \\( i \\) and \\( k \\).
