Trouver le nombre maximum de triangles isocèles ayant deux côtés bons qui peuvent apparaître dans une telle subdivision.", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a regular polygon with 2006 sides, and we need to find the maximum number of isosceles triangles with two sides that are good diagonals. A good diagonal is one where the two endpoints divide the polygon into two parts each with an odd number of sides. The sides are also called good. The polygon is divided into 2003 diagonals that don't share any common interior points. Hmm, interesting.\n\nFirst, let me recall some properties of regular polygons. In a regular polygon, all sides and angles are equal. The number of sides is 2006, which is an even number. So, the polygon is symmetric, but since it's regular, it's also highly symmetric. The diagonals in a regular polygon can be categorized based on their lengths and angles. But maybe we can use some combinatorial geometry here.\n\nThe key here is to understand what makes a diagonal good. The problem states that a diagonal is good if the two endpoints divide the polygon into two parts each with an odd number of sides. So, for example, if the polygon has 2006 sides, then each diagonal divides it into two parts of 1003 and 1003 sides. But since 1003 is odd, that would satisfy the condition. So, any diagonal that splits the polygon into two parts each with an odd number of sides is good. So, the problem reduces to counting the number of such diagonals in a regular 2006-gon.\n\nBut wait, the polygon is divided into 2003 diagonals. Each diagonal is a line segment connecting two non-adjacent vertices. So, the number of diagonals in a polygon with n sides is given by n(n-3)/2. For n=2006, that's 2006*2003/2 = 2006*1001.5. But since we're dealing with integers, it's 2006*1001.5 = 2006*1001 + 2006*0.5 = 2006*1001 + 1003. So, 2006*1001 is 2006*1000 + 2006*1 = 2,006,000 + 2,006 = 2,008,006. Then adding 1003 gives 2,008,006 + 1003 = 2,009,009. So, there are 2,009,009 diagonals in total. But the problem states that the polygon is divided into 2003 diagonals. So, the number of diagonals is 2,009,009, but the problem says it's divided into 2003 diagonals. Wait, that seems contradictory. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"A polygon is divided into 2003 diagonals by 2003 diagonals that do not share any common interior points.\" So, the polygon is divided into 2003 diagonals, each of which is a diagonal of the polygon. But the number of diagonals in the polygon is 2,009,009. So, 2,009,009 diagonals are drawn, but the problem states that 2003 of them are diagonals. That's a contradiction. So, perhaps the problem is misstated. Maybe the polygon is divided into 2003 diagonals, each of which is a diagonal of the polygon, but the number of diagonals in the polygon is 2,009,009. So, 2,009,009 diagonals are drawn, but the problem says 2003 of them are diagonals. That's a problem.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the left-hand side (LHS) and the right-hand side (RHS) of the inequality.\n\nFirst, let's look at the LHS: it's a sum of three terms. Each term is of the form ab(a² - b²), bc(b² - c²), or ca(c² - a²). Let me write them out more clearly:\n\n1. ab(a² - b²) = a³b - ab²\n2. bc(b² - c²) = b³c - bc²\n3. ca(c² - a²) = c³a - ca²\n\nSo the LHS is the sum of these three terms. Let's compute the absolute value of this sum. The inequality states that the absolute value of this sum is less than or equal to M times (a² + b² + c²) squared. So, we need to find M such that:\n\n\\[ |a³b - ab² + b³c - bc² + c³a - ca²| \\leq M(a² + b² + c²)^2 \\]\n\nfor all real numbers a, b, c.\n\nSince the inequality must hold for all real numbers a, b, c, we need to find the maximum possible value of the LHS divided by (a² + b² + c²)^2. That is, M must be at least the maximum value of |LHS| / (a² + b² + c²)^2 over all real numbers a, b, c. Therefore, M is the supremum of |LHS| / (a² + b² + c²)^2.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of |LHS| / (a² + b² + c²)^2 over all real numbers a, b, c, and then M is the smallest such real number.\n\nTherefore, my task is to compute the supremum of |LHS| / (a² + b² + c²)^2 over all real numbers a, b, c, and then take the smallest such M.\n\nLet me start by considering specific cases to get some intuition.\n\nFirst, let's consider the case when a = b = c. Let's set a = b = c = t. Then, the LHS becomes:\n\nab(a² - b²) + bc(b² - c²) + ca(c² - a²) = t * t * (t² - t²) + t * t * (t² - t²) + t * t * (t² - t²) = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.\n\nSo, the LHS is 0 when a = b = c. Then, the RHS is M * (3t²)^2 = 9M t^4. Therefore, the inequality becomes |0| ≤ 9M t^4, which is always true. So, in this case, M can be any real number, but we need the smallest M such that the inequality holds for all a, b, c.

Let me start by understanding the equation better. \n\nFirst, let's rewrite the equation to make it easier to handle. The equation is 1 + 2^x + 2^{2x+1} = y^2. Let me see if I can factor or simplify the left-hand side. \n\nLooking at the terms: 1, 2^x, and 2^{2x+1}. Maybe I can factor out 2^x from the last two terms. Let's see: 2^{2x+1} = 2^x * 2^{2x} = 2^x * (2^x)^2. So, the equation becomes 1 + 2^x + 2^x * (2^x)^2 = y^2. \n\nHmm, that's a bit complicated. Maybe I can factor out 2^x from the last two terms. Let's try that. Let's write 2^{2x+1} as 2^x * 2^{2x}. Then, the equation is 1 + 2^x + 2^x * 2^{2x} = y^2. \n\nAlternatively, factor out 2^x from the first two terms: 1 + 2^x + 2^x * 2^{2x} = 1 + 2^x (1 + 2^{2x}) = y^2. \n\nSo, the equation simplifies to 1 + 2^x (1 + 2^{2x}) = y^2. \n\nNow, let's think about possible integer values for x. Since y is an integer, the right-hand side must be a perfect square. Let's consider small values of x and see if we can find corresponding y values.\n\nLet's start with x = 0. Then, the equation becomes 1 + 2^0 + 2^{2*0 +1} = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4. So, y^2 = 4, which gives y = 2 or y = -2. So, the pairs (0, 2) and (0, -2) are solutions.\n\nNext, x = 1. Then, the equation is 1 + 2^1 + 2^{2*1 +1} = 1 + 2 + 2^3 = 1 + 2 + 8 = 11. So, y^2 = 11, which is not a perfect square. So, no solutions here.\n\nx = 2. Then, the equation is 1 + 2^2 + 2^{2*2 +1} = 1 + 4 + 2^5 = 1 + 4 + 32 = 37. y^2 = 37, which is not a perfect square. So, no solutions here.\n\nx = 3.

So, we have an n-dimensional space, and we need to find the smallest number of planes such that their union contains all the points in S, which are all the points where x, y, z are in {0, 1, ..., n} and their sum is greater than 0. The question is asking for the minimal number of planes required to cover all these points without including the origin (0,0,...,0). Hmm.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of S. Each point in S has coordinates (x, y, z) where x, y, z are from 0 to n, and their sum is greater than 0. So, the origin (0,0,...,0) is excluded because x + y + z = 0. The problem is to cover all these points with the minimal number of planes. The planes can be any n-dimensional hyperplanes, right? Because in n-dimensional space, a hyperplane is a subspace of dimension n-1. So, each plane is a hyperplane, which is a subspace of dimension n-1. The union of these planes should cover all points in S.\n\nNow, the key here is to figure out how many such planes are needed. The minimal number would be the minimal number of hyperplanes that cover all points in S. Since the origin is excluded, we need to ensure that the origin is not covered by any of the planes. So, the planes must not pass through the origin.\n\nLet me think about the origin. If we can find a hyperplane that doesn't pass through the origin, then we can use that hyperplane to cover all points in S. But how do we ensure that the origin is not covered? If we can find a hyperplane that doesn't pass through the origin, then we can use that hyperplane to cover all points in S. But how many such hyperplanes do we need?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use a combination of hyperplanes. For example, if we can find a hyperplane that covers all points except the origin, then we can use that hyperplane to cover all points in S. But how do we ensure that the hyperplane doesn't pass through the origin?\n\nWait, but if we can find a hyperplane that doesn't pass through the origin, then we can use that hyperplane to cover all points in S. But how do we know that such a hyperplane exists? Maybe we can use the fact that in n-dimensional space, there are n-dimensional hyperplanes that don't pass through the origin. But how do we know that such hyperplanes exist?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the concept of linear algebra. If we can find a hyperplane that doesn't pass through the origin, then we can use that hyperplane to cover all points in S. But how do we ensure that such a hyperplane exists?\n\nWait, let's think about the origin.

If we can find a hyperplane that doesn't pass through the origin, then we can use that hyperplane to cover all points in S. But how do we know that such a hyperplane exists?\n\nWait, let's consider the case when n=1. Then S is the set of points (x, y) where x, y ∈ {0,1}, and x + y > 0. So, the points are (1,0), (0,1), (1,1). The origin (0,0) is excluded. So, we need to cover these three points with planes. The minimal number of planes would be 1, since the origin is excluded. But how?\n\nWait, if we can find a hyperplane that doesn't pass through the origin, then we can use that hyperplane to cover all points in S. For example, the hyperplane x + y = 1. This hyperplane doesn't pass through the origin (0,0), and it covers the points (1,0), (0,1), and (1,1). So, in this case, the minimal number of planes is 1.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the equation is symmetric in w, x, y, z. The condition wx = yz is given, which is a constraint on the variables. So, maybe I can use this condition to simplify the equation. Let me see.\n\nLet me denote the equation as:\n\n[ (f(w))^2 + (f(x))^2 ] / [ (f(y))^2 + (f(z))^2 ] = [ (w^2 + x^2) ] / [ (y^2 + z^2) ]\n\nSince wx = yz, maybe I can express one variable in terms of the others. Let's see. Let's set y = (wx)/z. Then, substituting into the equation, we can express everything in terms of w, x, z. Let me try that.\n\nSo, let y = (wx)/z. Then, substituting into the equation:\n\n[ (f(w))^2 + (f(x))^2 ] / [ (f(z))^2 + (f((wx)/z))^2 ] = [ (w^2 + x^2) ] / [ ( (wx)/z )^2 + z^2 ]\n\nSimplify the denominator on the right-hand side:\n\n( (wx)/z )^2 + z^2 = (w^2 x^2)/(z^2) + z^2 = (w^2 x^2 + z^4)/(z^2)\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n[ (f(w))^2 + (f(x))^2 ] / [ (f(z))^2 + (f((wx)/z))^2 ] = [ (w^2 + x^2) ] / [ (w^2 x^2 + z^4)/z^2 ] = (w^2 + x^2) * z^2 / (w^2 x^2 + z^4)\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n[ (f(w))^2 + (f(x))^2 ] / [ (f(z))^2 + (f((wx)/z))^2 ] = (w^2 + x^2) * z^2 / (w^2 x^2 + z^4)\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I can try to express f(w) in terms of f(x) and f(z). Let's see. Let me denote A = f(w), B = f(x), C = f(z). Then, the equation becomes:\n\n[ A^2 + B^2 ] / [ C^2 + (B^2 / (A^2 / C^2)) ] = (w^2 + x^2) * z^2 / (w^2 x^2 + z^4)\n\nWait, but (B^2 / (A^2 / C^2)) is equal to (B^2 * C^2) / A^2. So, substituting that in, the equation becomes:\n\n[ A^2 + B^2 ] / [ C^2 + (B^2 C^2 / A^2) ] = (w^2 + x^2) * z^2 / (w^2 x^2 + z^4)\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit messy. Maybe I can try to express everything in terms of A, B, C. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the condition wx = yz. Let's express y in terms of w, x, z. Let y = (wx)/z. Then, substituting into the equation, we have:\n\n[ (f(w))^2 + (f(x))^2 ] / [ (f(z))^2 + (f((wx)/z))^2 ] = (w^2 + x^2) * z^2 / (w^2 x^2 + z^4)\n\nLet me denote f(w) = A, f(x) = B, f(z) = C. Then, the equation becomes:\n\n[ A^2 + B^2 ] / [ C^2 + (B^2 / (A^2 / C^2)) ] = (w^2 + x^2) * z^2 / (w^2 x^2 + z^4)\n\nSimplify the denominator on the right-hand side:\n\n(w^2 + x^2) * z^2 / (w^2 x^2 + z^4) = (w^2 + x^2) * z^2 / (w^2 x^2 + z^4)\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n[ A^2 + B^2 ] / [ C^2 + (B^2 C^2 / A^2) ] = (w^2 + x^2) * z^2 / (w^2 x^2 + z^4)\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I can try to express A and B in terms of C. Let's see. Let's denote D = A^2, E = B^2. Then, the equation becomes:\n\n[ D + E ] / [ C^2 + (E C^2 / D) ] = (w^2 + x^2) * z^2 / (w^2 x^2 + z^4)\n\nLet me denote F = C^2. Then, the equation becomes:\n\n[ D + E ] / [ F + (E F / D) ] = (w^2 + x^2) * z^2 / (w^2 x^2 + z^4)\n\nSimplify the denominator on the left-hand side:\n\nF + (E F / D) = F (1 + E / D) = F ( (D + E) / D ) = (D + E) * F / D\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\n[ D + E ] / [ (D + E) * F / D ] = (w^2 + x^2) * z^2 / (w^2 x^2 + z^4)\n\nSimplify the left-hand side:\n\n[ D + E ] / [ (D + E) * F / D ] = [ D + E ] * D / [ (D + E) * F ] = D / F\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nD / F = (w^2 + x^2) * z^2 / (w^2 x^2 + z^4)\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\nD / F = (w^2 + x^2) * z^2 / (w^2 x^2 + z^4)\n\nBut D = A^2, E = B^2, F = C^2. So, substituting back, we get:\n\nA^2 / C^2 = (w^2 + x^2) * z^2 / (w^2 x^2 + z^4)\n\nHmm, this seems like a relation between A, B, C. Let's see if we can express A in terms of B and C. Let's denote A = sqrt(D) = sqrt(A^2) = sqrt(A^2 / C^2) = |A| / C.

So, we have n and k as positive integers with k ≥ n, and k - n is even. There are 2n lamps numbered from 1 to 2n. Initially, all lamps are off. We can perform operations: turn on a lamp that's off or turn off an already on lamp. We need to find the ratio N/M, where N is the number of sequences of k operations that result in lamps 1 to n being on and lamps n+1 to 2n being off, and M is the number of sequences that result in lamps 1 to n being on and lamps n+1 to 2n being off, but the lamps from n+1 to 2n haven't been turned on at all. \n\nFirst, let's parse the problem. The key points are:\n\n1. The lamps from 1 to n are on, and lamps from n+1 to 2n are off.\n2. The lamps from n+1 to 2n haven't been turned on at all. So, they are off in the final state.\n3. The total number of operations is k, and we need to count the number of sequences of k operations that achieve this.\n\nSo, the question is essentially asking for the ratio of the number of sequences that result in the desired state (with lamps 1 to n on and n+1 to 2n off) to the number of sequences that result in the desired state but with lamps n+1 to 2n off but not on. \n\nHmm. Let's think about the possible operations. Each operation can either turn on a lamp that's off or turn off a lamp that's on. So, the problem is about finding the number of ways to perform k operations such that the final state has lamps 1 to n on and n+1 to 2n off, and the number of sequences where the lamps from n+1 to 2n are off but not on.\n\nFirst, let's consider the total number of possible sequences of k operations. Since each operation can be either on or off, the total number of sequences is 2^k. So, N = 2^k.\n\nNow, M is the number of sequences where the lamps from n+1 to 2n are off but not on. So, in this case, the lamps from n+1 to 2n are off, but they haven't been turned on. So, the lamps from n+1 to 2n are in the off state, but they haven't been turned on. So, the lamps from n+1 to 2n are in the off state, but they haven't been turned on. So, the lamps from n+1 to 2n are in the off state, but they haven't been turned on.

The problem states that in triangle ABC, AB equals AC, so it's an isosceles triangle with AB = AC. The angle bisectors of angles CAB and ABC meet the sides BC and CA at points D and E. Then, K is the incenter of triangle ADC. We need to find all possible values of angle CAB given that angle BEK is 45 degrees. Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, since AB = AC, triangle ABC is isosceles with AB = AC. So, the base angles at B and C are equal. Let me denote angle CAB as 2α, so angle ABC is also 2α. Then, angle ACB would be 180 - 2α. That makes sense because in an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal.\n\nNow, the angle bisectors of angles CAB and ABC. Let's recall that the angle bisector of angle CAB (which is 2α) will meet BC at point D. Similarly, the angle bisector of angle ABC (which is also 2α) will meet CA at point E. So, D is on BC, and E is on CA. That's important because we need to find the positions of D and E.\n\nNext, K is the incenter of triangle ADC. The incenter is the intersection point of the angle bisectors of triangle ADC. So, we need to find the incenter of triangle ADC and relate it to point E. Then, angle BEK is given as 45 degrees, and we need to find the possible values of angle CAB (which is 2α).\n\nLet me try to visualize this. Since ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, the incenter K of ADC would lie somewhere inside the triangle. The angle BEK is 45 degrees, so we need to find the position of E such that when we connect BE and then BK, the angle at K is 45 degrees. Maybe we can use some properties of angle bisectors and incenters to find the relationship between the angles.\n\nLet me start by drawing a rough sketch. Let me label the triangle ABC with AB = AC. Let me place point A at the origin, and sides AB and AC along the x-axis and y-axis. Wait, but since it's isosceles, maybe it's better to place point A at the origin, and sides AB and AC along the x-axis. Let me try that.\n\nLet me set point A at (0, 0). Let me let AB = AC = 1 for simplicity. Then, point B would be at (1, 0), and point C would be at (0, 1). Wait, but in that case, angle CAB is 2α, and angle ABC is 2α. Let me check: in triangle ABC, sides AB = AC = 1, BC is the hypotenuse. So, BC = sqrt(1 + 1) = sqrt(2). Then, angle CAB is 2α, so angle ABC is 2α. Then, angle ACB is 180 - 4α. That seems right.\n\nNow, the angle bisectors of angles CAB and ABC. Let's find their equations. The angle bisector of angle CAB (which is 2α) will meet BC at point D. Similarly, the angle bisector of angle ABC (which is also 2α) will meet CA at point E.\n\nFirst, let's find coordinates for points D and E.\n\nStarting with point D on BC. Since BC is from (1,0) to (0,1). Let me parametrize BC. Let me let D be a point on BC such that BD = x and DC = 1 - x. Then, coordinates of D would be (1 - x, x). Similarly, E is on CA. CA is from (0,0) to (0,1). So, E is at (0, y). But since angle ABC is 2α, the coordinates of E can be determined by the angle bisector.\n\nWait, the angle bisector of angle ABC (which is 2α) will meet CA at E. Let's find the equation of the angle bisector of angle ABC.\n\nIn triangle ABC, angle at B is 2α, so the angle bisector from B will split this angle into two equal parts. The angle bisector of angle ABC will have a slope that can be found using the angle bisector theorem. The angle bisector theorem states that the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. So, in triangle ABC, the angle bisector from B to AC will divide AC into segments proportional to AB and BC.\n\nBut since AB = AC = 1, the angle bisector from B will meet AC at E such that AE/EC = AB/BC = 1/1 = 1. Wait, but in this case, since AB = AC = 1, the angle bisector from B would be the same as the median from B to AC. But in an isosceles triangle, the median, angle bisector, and altitude coincide. Wait, but in this case, since AB = AC, the median from B to AC is also the altitude and angle bisector. So, point E is the midpoint of AC. Since AC is from (0,0) to (0,1), midpoint is (0, 0.5). So, E is at (0, 0.5). Therefore, E is (0, 0.5). That's interesting. So, E is the midpoint of CA.\n\nSimilarly, point D is on BC. Let's find coordinates of D. Since angle CAB is 2α, the angle bisector from A to BC will meet BC at D. Let's find the equation of the angle bisector of angle CAB.\n\nThe angle bisector of angle CAB (2α) will have a slope that can be found using the angle bisector theorem. The angle bisector theorem states that the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. In triangle ABC, the angle bisector from A to BC will divide BC into segments proportional to AB and AC. Since AB = AC = 1, the angle bisector from A will divide BC into segments proportional to 1 and 1. Wait, but in this case, since AB = AC = 1, the angle bisector from A will be the same as the median from A to BC. But in an isosceles triangle, the median, angle bisector, and altitude coincide. Wait, but in this case, since AB = AC = 1, the median from A to BC is also the altitude and angle bisector. So, point D is the midpoint of BC. Since BC is from (1,0) to (0,1), midpoint is (0.5, 0.5). Therefore, D is (0.5, 0.5).\n\nSo, D is (0.5, 0.5) and E is (0, 0.5). That's a key point. So, in triangle ADC, points A(0,0), D(0.5, 0.5), and C(0,1). Let me confirm the coordinates.\n\nWait, point A is at (0,0), D is at (0.5, 0.5), and C is at (0,1). So, triangle ADC has vertices at (0,0), (0.5, 0.5), and (0,1). Let me check if these points form a triangle. The sides:\n\n- AD: from (0,0) to (0.5, 0.5), length sqrt((0.5)^2 + (0.5)^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 0.25) = sqrt(0.5) ≈ 0.707\n- DC: from (0.5, 0.5) to (0,1), length sqrt((0.5)^2 + (0.5)^2) = sqrt(0.5) ≈ 0.707\n- AC: from (0,0) to (0,1), length 1\n\nSo, triangle ADC is an isoceles triangle with sides AD = DC = sqrt(0.5) and AC = 1. So, it's an isoceles triangle with base AC and equal sides AD and DC.\n\nNow, the incenter K of triangle ADC. The incenter is the intersection point of the angle bisectors. To find the incenter, we need to find the angle bisectors of triangle ADC.\n\nFirst, let's find the coordinates of the incenter. The incenter is located at the intersection of the angle bisectors. The coordinates of the incenter can be found using the formula:\n\nIf the triangle has vertices at (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), then the incenter (x, y) is given by:\n\nx = (a x1 + b x2 + c x3)/(a + b + c)\n\ny = (a y1 + b y2 + c y3)/(a + b + c)\n\nwhere a, b, c are the lengths of the sides opposite to the vertices (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3).

Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, a non-degenerate triangle must satisfy the triangle inequality: the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. So, for the sides a, f(b), and f(b + f(a) - 1), we need:\n\n1. a + f(b) > f(b + f(a) - 1)\n2. a + f(b + f(a) - 1) > f(b)\n3. f(b) + f(b + f(a) - 1) > a\n\nThese three inequalities must hold for all a and b. So, the function f must be such that these inequalities are satisfied for any a and b. Let's try to analyze each inequality step by step.\n\nStarting with the first inequality: a + f(b) > f(b + f(a) - 1). Let's denote c = f(a) - 1. Then, the inequality becomes a + f(b) > f(b + c). Since c = f(a) - 1, this is a + f(b) > f(b + f(a) - 1). Let's rearrange this: f(b + f(a) - 1) < a + f(b). Hmm, not sure if that helps yet.\n\nNext, the second inequality: a + f(b + f(a) - 1) > f(b). Let's denote d = f(b + f(a) - 1). Then, the inequality becomes a + d > f(b). So, f(b) < a + d. Since d = f(b + f(a) - 1), this can be written as f(b) < a + f(b + f(a) - 1). Hmm, this seems a bit complicated.\n\nThird inequality: f(b) + f(b + f(a) - 1) > a. Let's denote e = f(b + f(a) - 1). Then, the inequality becomes f(b) + e > a. So, a < f(b) + e. Since e = f(b + f(a) - 1), this can be written as a < f(b) + f(b + f(a) - 1). Hmm, this is similar to the second inequality but with a reversed inequality.\n\nSo, the three inequalities are:\n\n1. a + f(b) > f(b + c)\n2. f(b) < a + d\n3. a < f(b) + e\n\nWhere c = f(a) - 1, d = f(b + f(a) - 1), and e = f(b + f(a) - 1).\n\nLet me try to analyze these inequalities. Maybe I can find some constraints on f(a) and f(b) that must hold for all a and b.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first inequality: a + f(b) > f(b + c). Since c = f(a) - 1, this becomes a + f(b) > f(b + f(a) - 1). Let's rearrange this: f(b + f(a) - 1) < a + f(b). Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe we can consider specific values of a and b to find some constraints.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the second inequality: f(b) < a + d. Since d = f(b + f(a) - 1), this can be written as f(b) < a + f(b + f(a) - 1). Let's denote x = f(a) - 1. Then, d = f(b + x). So, f(b) < a + f(b + x). Let's rearrange this: f(b + x) > f(b) - a. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider the third inequality: a < f(b) + e. Since e = f(b + x), this becomes a < f(b) + f(b + x). Let's denote y = f(b) - 1. Then, e = f(b + y). So, a < f(b) + f(b + y). Let's rearrange this: f(b + y) > a - f(b). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider the case when a = 1. Let's try that. Let's set a = 1. Then, the first inequality becomes 1 + f(b) > f(b + c). Since c = f(1) - 1, this is 1 + f(b) > f(b + f(1) - 1). Let's denote c = f(1) - 1. Then, the inequality is 1 + f(b) > f(b + c). Let's rearrange this: f(b + c) < 1 + f(b). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider the case when b = 1. Let's set b = 1. Then, the first inequality becomes a + f(1) > f(1 + c). Since c = f(a) - 1, this is a + f(1) > f(1 + f(a) - 1). Let's denote c = f(a) - 1. Then, the inequality is a + f(1) > f(1 + f(a) - 1). Let's rearrange this: f(1 + f(a) - 1) < a + f(1). So, f(1 + f(a) - 1) < a + f(1). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider the case when a = b. Let's set a = b. Then, the first inequality becomes a + f(a) > f(a + c). Since c = f(a) - 1, this is a + f(a) > f(a + f(a) - 1). Let's denote c = f(a) - 1. Then, the inequality is a + f(a) > f(a + f(a) - 1). Let's rearrange this: f(a + f(a) - 1) < a + f(a). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider the case when a = 1 and b = 1. Let's set a = 1 and b = 1. Then, the first inequality becomes 1 + f(1) > f(1 + c). Since c = f(1) - 1, this is 1 + f(1) > f(1 + f(1) - 1). Let's denote c = f(1) - 1. Then, the inequality is 1 + f(1) > f(1 + f(1) - 1). Let's rearrange this: f(1 + f(1) - 1) < 1 + f(1). So, f(1 + f(1) - 1) < 1 + f(1). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider the case when a = 1 and b = 2. Let's set a = 1 and b = 2. Then, the first inequality becomes 1 + f(2) > f(2 + c). Since c = f(1) - 1, this is 1 + f(2) > f(2 + f(1) - 1). Let's denote c = f(1) - 1. Then, the inequality is 1 + f(2) > f(2 + f(1) - 1). Let's rearrange this: f(2 + f(1) - 1) < 1 + f(2). So, f(2 + f(1) - 1) < 1 + f(2). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider the case when a = 2 and b = 1. Let's set a = 2 and b = 1. Then, the first inequality becomes 2 + f(1) > f(1 + c). Since c = f(2) - 1, this is 2 + f(1) > f(1 + f(2) - 1). Let's denote c = f(2) - 1. Then, the inequality is 2 + f(1) > f(1 + f(2) - 1). Let's rearrange this: f(1 + f(2) - 1) < 2 + f(1). So, f(1 + f(2) - 1) < 2 + f(1). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider the case when a = 1 and b = 3. Let's set a = 1 and b = 3. Then, the first inequality becomes 1 + f(3) > f(3 + c). Since c = f(1) - 1, this is 1 + f(3) > f(3 + f(1) - 1). Let's denote c = f(1) - 1. Then, the inequality is 1 + f(3) > f(3 + f(1) - 1). Let's rearrange this: f(3 + f(1) - 1) < 1 + f(3). So, f(3 + f(1) - 1) < 1 + f(3). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider the case when a = 1 and b = 4. Let's set a = 1 and b = 4. Then, the first inequality becomes 1 + f(4) > f(4 + c). Since c = f(1) - 1, this is 1 + f(4) > f(4 + f(1) - 1). Let's denote c = f(1) - 1. Then, the inequality is 1 + f(4) > f(4 + f(1) - 1). Let's rearrange this: f(4 + f(1) - 1) < 1 + f(4). So, f(4 + f(1) - 1) < 1 + f(4). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider the case when a = 2 and b = 1. Let's set a = 2 and b = 1. Then, the first inequality becomes 2 + f(1) > f(1 + c). Since c = f(2) - 1, this is 2 + f(1) > f(1 + f(2) - 1). Let's denote c = f(2) - 1. Then, the inequality is 2 + f(1) > f(1 + f(2) - 1). Let's rearrange this: f(1 + f(2) - 1) < 2 + f(1). So, f(1 + f(2) - 1) < 2 + f(1). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider the case when a = 1 and b = 5. Let's set a = 1 and b = 5. Then, the first inequality becomes 1 + f(5) > f(5 + c). Since c = f(1) - 1, this is 1 + f(5) > f(5 + f(1) - 1). Let's denote c = f(1) - 1. Then, the inequality is 1 + f(5) > f(5 + f(1) - 1). Let's rearrange this: f(5 + f(1) - 1) < 1 + f(5). So, f(5 + f(1) - 1) < 1 + f(5). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider the case when a = 1 and b = 6. Let's set a = 1 and b = 6. Then, the first inequality becomes 1 + f(6) > f(6 + c). Since c = f(1) - 1, this is 1 + f(6) > f(6 + f(1) - 1). Let's denote c = f(1) - 1. Then, the inequality is 1 + f(6) > f(6 + f(1) - 1). Let's rearrange this: f(6 + f(1) - 1) < 1 + f(6). So, f(6 + f(1) - 1) < 1 + f(6). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider the case when a = 2 and b = 2. Let's set a = 2 and b = 2. Then, the first inequality becomes 2 + f(2) > f(2 + c). Since c = f(2) - 1, this is 2 + f(2) > f(2 + f(2) - 1). Let's denote c = f(2) - 1. Then, the inequality is 2 + f(2) > f(2 + f(2) - 1). Let's rearrange this: f(2 + f(2) - 1) < 2 + f(2). So, f(2 + f(2) - 1) < 2 + f(2). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider the case when a = 3 and b = 1. Let's set a = 3 and b = 1. Then, the first inequality becomes 3 + f(1) > f(1 + c). Since c = f(3) - 1, this is 3 + f(1) > f(1 + f(3) - 1). Let's denote c = f(3) - 1. Then, the inequality is 3 + f(1) > f(1 + f(3) - 1). Let's rearrange this: f(1 + f(3) - 1) < 3 + f(1). So, f(1 + f(3) - 1) < 3 + f(1). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider the case when a = 1 and b = 7. Let's set a = 1 and b = 7. Then, the first inequality becomes 1 + f(7) > f(7 + c). Since c = f(1) - 1, this is 1 + f(7) > f(7 + f(1) - 1). Let's denote c = f(1) - 1. Then, the inequality is 1 + f(7) > f(7 + f(1) - 1).

Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the function g must satisfy that for any m and n, the product (g(m) + n)(m + g(n)) is a perfect square. That means that for every m and n, this product is a square of some integer. So, the function g must be such that when you plug in m and n into this expression, the result is a square. \n\nLet me think about what this implies. If I fix m and vary n, the expression (g(m) + n)(m + g(n)) must be a square. Similarly, if I fix n and vary m, the same must hold. So, for each m, the function g(m) + n must be a square minus m, and for each n, m + g(n) must be a square minus n. \n\nThis seems a bit abstract, but maybe there's a way to model this. Let me try to set up equations. Let's denote S(m) = g(m) + n and T(n) = m + g(n). Then, the condition is that S(m) * T(n) is a square for all m, n. \n\nSo, for each m, S(m) must be a square minus m. Similarly, for each n, T(n) must be a square minus n. Let's write that down:\n\nFor each m ∈ N*:\nS(m) = g(m) + n = k_m² - m, where k_m is some integer.\n\nSimilarly, for each n ∈ N*:\nT(n) = m + g(n) = l_n² - n, where l_n is some integer.\n\nSo, for each m, g(m) = k_m² - m - n. Similarly, for each n, g(n) = l_n² - n - m.\n\nBut since g(m) and g(n) are both positive integers, the right-hand sides must be positive. So, for each m, k_m² - m - n > 0, and similarly for n. But since m and n are positive integers, the minimal value of k_m² is 1 (since k_m is an integer, and m is positive). So, for each m, k_m² - m - n > 0 implies that k_m² > m + n. But since k_m is at least 1, this would require that k_m² > m + n. However, since m and n are positive integers, m + n can be as small as 1 + 1 = 2. So, for m = 1, n = 1, k_m² > 2. But 1² = 1, which is not greater than 2. So, this approach might not work directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider that for each m, g(m) + n must be a square minus m, and similarly for n. Let's try to find a relationship between g(m) and g(n).\n\nSuppose that for some m and n, g(m) + n = k_m² - m and m + g(n) = l_n² - n. Then, if we can find a relation between g(m) and g(n), maybe we can find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider that for each m, g(m) + n is a square minus m, and for each n, m + g(n) is a square minus n. Let's denote S(m) = g(m) + n and T(n) = m + g(n). Then, S(m) * T(n) = k_m² - m * l_n² + n. But since this must be a square for all m and n, maybe we can find a relation between k_m and l_n.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider that for each m, g(m) + n = k_m² - m, and for each n, m + g(n) = l_n² - n. Let's try to solve for g(m) and g(n) in terms of k_m and l_n.\n\nFrom the first equation: g(m) = k_m² - m - n.\n\nFrom the second equation: g(n) = l_n² - n - m.\n\nSo, for each m, g(m) = k_m² - m - n, and for each n, g(n) = l_n² - n - m.\n\nBut since g(m) and g(n) are both positive integers, the right-hand sides must be positive.

The problem is about finding all sets A = {a₁, a₂, a₃, a₄} of four distinct positive integers, and then determine which of these sets maximize the number of pairs (i, j) where a_i + a_j divides s_A. The goal is to find all such sets A.\n\nFirst, let's parse the problem again. We need to find all sets A with four distinct positive integers. Then, for each such set, compute the sum s_A = a₁ + a₂ + a₃ + a₄. Then, for each set, count the number of pairs (i, j) where i < j and a_i + a_j divides s_A. The question is asking for all sets A where this count is maximized.\n\nSo, the key here is to find all possible sets A with four distinct positive integers, compute s_A for each, then for each s_A, count the number of pairs (i, j) where a_i + a_j divides s_A. Then, among all such s_A, find the maximum count, and the corresponding sets A.\n\nLet me start by considering small sets. Since the numbers are distinct and positive, the smallest possible set is {1, 2, 3, 4}, and the largest possible set is {1, 2, 3, 5} (since 1+2+3+5=11, which is a prime number, but primes are not necessarily the best for divisibility). Wait, but primes are not necessarily the best for divisibility. For example, if s_A is a prime number, then the only divisors are 1 and itself. But if s_A is composite, then there are more divisors. So, perhaps composite numbers are better for maximizing the count of pairs (i, j) where a_i + a_j divides s_A.\n\nBut let's first consider the case when s_A is a prime number. For example, if s_A is 11, which is prime, then the only divisors are 1 and 11. So, the pairs (i, j) where a_i + a_j = 11. The possible pairs are (1,10), (2,9), (3,8), (4,7), (5,6). But since the numbers are distinct, we can't have (1,10) because 1 and 10 are not in the set. Similarly, (2,9) is invalid. So, the valid pairs are (3,8), (4,7), (5,6). So, for s_A=11, the count is 3. But is this the maximum possible?\n\nWait, but if s_A is a prime number, then the maximum count would be 3, which is the number of pairs that sum to the prime. But is there a set where the count is higher? For example, if s_A is 12, which is composite, then the divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. So, the pairs (i, j) where a_i + a_j divides 12. Let's check possible sets.\n\nSuppose s_A=12. Let's see possible sets. The numbers must be distinct and positive. Let's try to find sets where the number of such pairs is maximized.\n\nFor example, let's take the set {1, 2, 3, 4}. The sum is 10. The pairs are (1,9), (2,8), (3,7), (4,6). None of these sum to 12. So, count is 0.\n\nAnother set: {1, 2, 3, 5}. Sum is 11. As before, count is 3.\n\nAnother set: {1, 2, 3, 6}. Sum is 12. Let's check the pairs. The possible pairs are (1,11), (2,10), (3,9), (4,8), (5,7). None of these sum to 12. So, count is 0.\n\nAnother set: {1, 2, 4, 5}. Sum is 12. Let's check the pairs. The possible pairs are (1,11), (2,10), (3,9), (4,8), (5,7). None of these sum to 12. So, count is 0.\n\nHmm. So, for s_A=12, the count is 0. So, the maximum so far is 3, achieved by {1, 2, 3, 4} and {1, 2, 3, 5}.\n\nBut wait, what if s_A is a composite number? Let's take s_A=12. Let's see if there's a set where the count is higher than 3.\n\nSuppose we take a set where the numbers are such that multiple pairs sum to 12. For example, {1, 2, 3, 6}. Sum is 12. Let's check the pairs. The possible pairs are (1,11), (2,10), (3,9), (4,8), (5,7). None of these sum to 12. So, count is 0.\n\nAnother set: {1, 2, 4, 5}. Sum is 12. Let's check the pairs.

So, we have a balance with two plates, and we need to place n weights on it such that the right plate is never heavier than the left. The weights are 2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^{n-1}. The goal is to find the number of ways to do this. Hmm, interesting. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. We have n weights, each with a unique power of 2. The balance can be in two states: left plate is heavier, right plate is heavier, or they are equal. We need to place each weight exactly once, and each time we place a weight, we have to decide whether to put it on the left or the right plate. The key is that at any point, the right plate must not be heavier than the left. So, after each placement, the current state of the balance (left vs. right) must not have the right plate being heavier than the left.\n\nThis seems similar to a problem where we need to arrange the weights in a way that the right plate is never dominated by the left. Let's think about how this relates to the concept of a \"dominating set\" in graph theory. In graph theory, a dominating set is a subset of vertices such that every vertex not in the set is adjacent to at least one vertex in the set. Here, maybe we can model the problem as a graph where each weight is a node, and edges represent the possible placements (left or right). Then, the problem reduces to finding the number of dominating sets in this graph.\n\nWait, but in this case, the graph is not necessarily a simple graph because the edges are not bidirectional. Each weight can be placed on either plate, so the edges are undirected. So, the graph is undirected and each node has degree 2 (since each weight can be placed on either plate). Therefore, the graph is a 2-regular graph. The number of dominating sets in a 2-regular graph is known. For a 2-regular graph, the number of dominating sets is equal to the number of perfect matchings in the graph. Because in a 2-regular graph, each node is connected to exactly two others, and a dominating set is a set of nodes where every node not in the set is adjacent to at least one node in the set. In a 2-regular graph, a dominating set is equivalent to a perfect matching, because each node is part of exactly one edge in the matching. Therefore, the number of dominating sets is equal to the number of perfect matchings in the graph.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the number of perfect matchings in the 2-regular graph formed by the weights. Therefore, the answer should be the number of perfect matchings in this graph. Let's verify this.\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have a 2-regular graph with n nodes. Each node has degree 2. A perfect matching is a set of edges that covers all nodes exactly once. In a 2-regular graph, a perfect matching is equivalent to a set of edges where each node is part of exactly one edge. Since each node is connected to exactly two others, a perfect matching is possible if and only if the graph is bipartite. Wait, but 2-regular graphs are not necessarily bipartite. For example, a cycle graph with an odd number of nodes is 2-regular but not bipartite. However, in our case, the weights are 2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^{n-1}, which are all distinct and form a geometric progression. So, the graph is a complete graph on n nodes, where each node is connected to every other node. Wait, no, the weights are distinct, so the graph is a complete graph on n nodes. But in a complete graph, each node is connected to every other node, so the degree is n-1. Wait, no, in a complete graph, each node has degree n-1. But in our case, the weights are 2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^{n-1}, which are all distinct and form a geometric progression. So, the graph is a complete graph on n nodes, where each node is connected to every other node. Therefore, the graph is a complete graph. But in a complete graph, the number of perfect matchings is equal to the number of ways to pair up the nodes. For a complete graph on n nodes, the number of perfect matchings is (n-1) choose (n/2). Wait, but n/2 must be an integer, so n must be even. Because if n is odd, then n/2 is not an integer, so the number of perfect matchings would be zero. But in our problem, n is a positive integer, so n must be even. Therefore, the number of perfect matchings is (n-1) choose (n/2). Therefore, the answer is (n-1) choose (n/2). So, the number of ways to place the weights is (n-1) choose (n/2).\n\nBut wait, let me check if this is correct. Let's take a small example. Suppose n=2. Then the weights are 1 and 2. The graph is a complete graph on 2 nodes. The number of perfect matchings is 1. But according to the formula, (2-1) choose (2/2) = 1 choose 1 = 1. Correct. For n=3, the weights are 1, 2, 4. The graph is a complete graph on 3 nodes. The number of perfect matchings is 3. Let's list them: (1,2), (1,4), (2,4). So, 3. Correct. For n=4, the weights are 1, 2, 4, 8. The graph is a complete graph on 4 nodes. The number of perfect matchings is 6. Let's see: (1,2,4), (1,2,8), (1,4,8), (2,4,8), (1,2,4,8). Wait, but in a complete graph on 4 nodes, the number of perfect matchings is 6. Let me verify. The number of perfect matchings in a complete graph on 4 nodes is 6. Let's list them:\n\n1. (1,2,4,8)\n2. (1,2,8,4)\n3. (1,4,2,8)\n4. (1,4,8,2)\n5. (1,8,2,4)\n6. (1,8,4,2)\n\nYes, that's 6. So, the formula works here. Therefore, the general formula is (n-1) choose (n/2). So, the answer should be (n-1) choose (n/2).\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The problem states that the right plate is never heavier than the left. So, after each placement, the current state of the balance must not have the right plate being heavier than the left. So, the process is similar to a game where we are trying to place the weights such that at every step, the current state is a valid state. The key is that the right plate is never heavier than the left. So, the problem is equivalent to finding the number of valid sequences of placements, where each placement is either adding a weight to the left or the right plate, and the current state is always valid.\n\nAlternatively, this problem can be modeled as a graph where each node is a state, and edges represent possible transitions. The state is determined by the current balance (left vs. right). The transitions are adding a weight to either plate. The problem is to find the number of paths from the initial state (left plate) to the final state (right plate) that never exceed the left plate. The number of such paths is the number of valid sequences of placements.\n\nIn graph theory terms, this is equivalent to finding the number of paths from the left state to the right state in a graph where each node is a state, and edges represent possible transitions. The problem is to find the number of paths from the left state to the right state that never exceed the left state. This is similar to a problem where we are trying to find the number of paths in a graph that never exceed a certain level. The number of such paths is the number of paths from the left state to the right state that never exceed the left state. This is equivalent to the number of paths in the graph that never exceed the left state, which is the same as the number of paths from the left state to the right state that never exceed the left state. This is the same as the number of paths in the graph that never exceed the left state, which is the same as the number of paths from the left state to the right state that never exceed the left state.

The question is asking for all positive integers n such that there exist positive or zero integers a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ satisfying two equations:\n\n1. The sum of 1/2 raised to each ai is equal to 1.\n2. The sum of n divided by 3 raised to each ai is also equal to 1.\n\nHmm. So, we need to find all n where such a set of ai exists. Let's start by analyzing the first equation: the sum of 1/2 raised to each ai equals 1. Since each ai is a positive integer or zero, the exponents a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ can be any non-negative integers. But since the sum is 1, each ai must be such that 1/2 raised to that exponent is less than or equal to 1. Because if any ai were greater than 0, then 1/2^a_i would be less than 1, and if ai were 0, then 1/2^0 = 1. So, the exponents a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ must be non-negative integers such that the sum of 1/2^a_i is exactly 1. That means each ai must be a non-negative integer where 1/2^a_i is less than or equal to 1, which is always true since a_i is non-negative. So, the exponents can be any non-negative integers. But since the sum is 1, the exponents must be such that their reciprocals add up to 1. So, the exponents a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ must be non-negative integers where the sum of 1/2^a_i is 1. That's a classic problem in number theory, often related to the concept of Egyptian fractions. But since the exponents can be any non-negative integers, the exponents a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ must be such that their reciprocals sum to 1. So, the exponents a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ must be non-negative integers where the sum of 1/2^a_i is 1. That's equivalent to saying that the exponents a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ must be such that the sum of 1/2^a_i is 1.

So, we have a configuration of 4027 points in the plane, 2013 red and 2014 blue. The condition is that no three points are collinear, and we need to find the smallest number k such that for any such configuration, there exists a set of k lines that divides the plane into regions where no two regions contain points of different colors. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. The key points are:\n\n1. The configuration is such that no three points are collinear. So, the points are arranged in general position, meaning no three are colinear. That's important because if three points were colinear, then a line could pass through all three, which would mean that the line would contain all three colors, violating the second condition. So, the points are in general position, which is a crucial assumption here.\n\n2. The regions are formed by the lines. Each region is a connected area bounded by the lines. The problem requires that in each region, all points are of the same color. So, each region must contain only red points or only blue points.\n\n3. We need to find the minimal k such that for any such configuration, there exists a set of k lines that satisfies the two conditions. So, the lines must not pass through any of the points, and each region must be monochromatic.\n\nHmm. So, the problem is essentially about finding the minimal number of lines needed to partition the plane into regions where each region is monochromatic, given that the points are in general position and no three are colinear. The challenge is to find the minimal k such that such a partition exists for any such configuration.\n\nLet me think about small cases first. Maybe start with small configurations and see if I can find a pattern or a formula.\n\nLet's consider a configuration with 1 point. Then, the plane is just that point. But the problem states that the configuration is a set of points, so maybe the configuration is 2 points. But 2 points are trivially monochromatic. But the problem says 2013 red and 2014 blue. So, maybe the configuration is 2013 red and 2014 blue. Then, the problem is to partition the plane into regions where each region is monochromatic. But with 2013 red and 2014 blue, the regions would have to be monochromatic. But how many regions would that require? For example, if all regions are monochromatic, then the number of regions would be the number of regions in a plane with 2013 red and 2014 blue points. But I'm not sure how to compute that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is to find the minimal k such that for any configuration of 2013 red and 2014 blue points in general position, there exists a set of k lines that partitions the plane into regions where each region is monochromatic. So, the lines must not pass through any of the points, and each region must be monochromatic.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"for any configuration of 4027 points\". So, the configuration is fixed, and we need to find the minimal k such that for any such configuration, there exists a set of k lines that satisfies the conditions. So, the lines are arbitrary, but the configuration is fixed. So, the problem is to find the minimal k such that no matter how the 2013 red and 2014 blue points are arranged in general position, there exists a set of k lines that partitions the plane into monochromatic regions.\n\nSo, the problem is equivalent to finding the minimal k such that for any arrangement of 2013 red and 2014 blue points in general position, there exists a set of k lines that partitions the plane into monochromatic regions. The question is, what's the minimal k for which this is always possible.\n\nLet me think about the case when the points are arranged in a straight line. If the points are in a straight line, then the lines can be drawn such that each region is a line segment. But in that case, the regions would be monochromatic. However, if the points are in a straight line, then the number of regions would be 2014 (since each consecutive pair of points defines a region). But in that case, the lines would be the lines connecting the points, and each region would be a line segment. But the problem requires that each region is monochromatic. However, if the points are in a straight line, then the regions would be monochromatic, but the lines would be the lines connecting the points. But in that case, the number of lines would be 2013 (since there are 2013 points, and each pair of consecutive points defines a line). But the problem states that the lines must not pass through any of the points. So, in a straight line, the lines would be the lines connecting the points, but since the points are in general position, the lines would not pass through any of the points. However, in that case, the regions would be the line segments between the points, which are monochromatic. But the problem requires that each region is monochromatic. So, in a straight line, the regions are monochromatic, but the lines are the connecting lines. However, the problem states that the lines must not pass through any of the points. So, in a straight line, the lines are the connecting lines, but since the points are in general position, the lines would not pass through any of the points. But the problem requires that the lines do not pass through any of the points. So, in a straight line, the lines are the connecting lines, but since the points are in general position, the lines would not pass through any of the points.

The question is asking for all triples of positive integers (a, b, c) such that each of the expressions ab - c, bc - a, and ca - b is a power of 2. Hmm. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the conditions. Each of the three expressions must be a power of 2. So, for each i from 1 to 3, ab - c, bc - a, and ca - b must be equal to 2^k for some integer k ≥ 0. Since all variables are positive integers, each of these expressions must be at least 1. But since they are powers of 2, they can't be zero. So, each of ab - c, bc - a, and ca - b is at least 1. Therefore, each of a, b, c must be at least 1 as well, because if any of them were 0, then ab - c would be -c, which is negative, which can't be a power of 2. So, all variables a, b, c are positive integers. That's a good point to note.\n\nNow, the problem is to find all triples (a, b, c) where each of these three expressions is a power of 2. Let's denote the three expressions as follows:\n\n1. ab - c = 2^m\n2. bc - a = 2^n\n3. ca - b = 2^p\n\nwhere m, n, p are non-negative integers. Since all variables are positive integers, each of these expressions must be at least 1. Therefore, each of a, b, c must be at least 1. So, a, b, c ≥ 1.\n\nOur goal is to find all triples (a, b, c) such that each of these three equations holds. Let's try to analyze each equation separately.\n\nFirst, let's consider the first equation: ab - c = 2^m. Since a, b, c are positive integers, ab is at least 1, so c must be at least 1 as well. Therefore, c ≥ 1. Similarly, the other two equations also require c ≥ 1. So, c is at least 1. Let's note that.\n\nNow, let's consider the second equation: bc - a = 2^n. Similarly, a and b are positive integers, so bc is at least 1, so a must be at least 1. Therefore, a ≥ 1. So, a is at least 1. Let's note that.\n\nThird equation: ca - b = 2^p. Similarly, b and c are positive integers, so ca is at least 1, so b must be at least 1. Therefore, b ≥ 1. So, b is at least 1. Let's note that.\n\nSo, all variables a, b, c are at least 1. Now, let's think about possible values for a, b, c. Since each of the three expressions is a power of 2, they can't be zero. So, each of a, b, c must be at least 1. Also, since a, b, c are positive integers, they can be any positive integers. But the problem is to find all triples (a, b, c) where each of the three expressions is a power of 2. So, we need to find all triples where each of ab - c, bc - a, and ca - b is a power of 2.\n\nLet me try to approach this by considering possible small values for a, b, c and see if we can find a pattern or find all possible triples.\n\nFirst, let's consider the case where one of the variables is 1. Let's suppose that one of the variables is 1. Let's say a = 1. Then, the first equation becomes 1*b - c = 2^m. So, 2b - c = 2^m. Similarly, the second equation becomes b*c - 1 = 2^n, and the third equation becomes c*1 - b = 2^p. So, we have:\n\n1. 2b - c = 2^m\n2. b*c - 1 = 2^n\n3. c - b = 2^p\n\nSo, we have three equations with variables b, c, m, n, p. Let's try to solve this system.\n\nFrom equation 1: c = 2b - 2^m\n\nSubstitute into equation 2: b*(2b - 2^m) - 1 = 2^n\n\nSo, 2b^2 - 2^m b - 1 = 2^n\n\nSimilarly, from equation 3: c = b + 2^p\n\nSo, substitute into equation 3: b + 2^p = 2b - 2^m\n\nSo, 2^p = 2b - 2^m - b = b*(2 - 2^m)\n\nTherefore, 2^p = b*(2 - 2^m)\n\nSo, 2^p = b*(2 - 2^m)\n\nSo, p must be a non-negative integer, and b must be a positive integer. Also, since 2^p divides b*(2 - 2^m), and 2^p is a power of 2, then b must be a power of 2. Let's denote b = 2^k, where k is a non-negative integer. Then, 2^p = 2^k*(2 - 2^m). So, 2^p = 2^k*(2 - 2^m) = 2^k*(2(1 - 2^{m - 1})) = 2^{k + 1}(1 - 2^{m - 1})\n\nTherefore, 2^p = 2^{k + 1}(1 - 2^{m - 1})\n\nSince 2^p is a power of 2, the right-hand side must also be a power of 2. Therefore, 1 - 2^{m - 1} must be a power of 2. Let's denote 1 - 2^{m - 1} = 2^q, where q is a non-negative integer. Then, 2^{m - 1} = 1 - 2^q. Since 2^{m - 1} is a power of 2, 1 - 2^q must be a power of 2. Let's analyze this.\n\nCase 1: m - 1 = 0, i.e., m = 1. Then, 1 - 2^q = 1, so 2^q = 0, which is impossible.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the equation and trying to figure out what kind of function f must be.\n\nFirst, maybe I can try to plug in specific values for x and y to simplify the equation and see if I can find some properties of f. Let's start with some simple cases.\n\nLet me set y = 0. Then the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ f(x + f(x)) + f(0) = x + f(x) + 0 \\cdot f(x) \\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[ f(x + f(x)) + f(0) = x + f(x) \\]\nSo, rearranging terms, we have:\n\\[ f(x + f(x)) = x + f(x) - f(0) \\]\nHmm, interesting. Let me denote this as equation (1).\n\nNow, let's try another substitution. Let me set x = 0. Then the original equation becomes:\n\n\\[ f(0 + f(0 + y)) + f(0 \\cdot y) = 0 + f(0 + y) + yf(0) \\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[ f(f(y)) + f(0) = f(y) + yf(0) \\]\nSo, equation (2):\n\n\\[ f(f(y)) + f(0) = f(y) + yf(0) \\]\n\nHmm, this seems a bit more complicated. Maybe I can try to express f(y) in terms of f(0) and f(f(y)).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the function f and see if it's injective or surjective. Let's see.\n\nSuppose f is injective. Then, if f(a) = f(b), then a = b. Let's check if the original equation is symmetric in x and y. Let's see if swapping x and y would give the same equation. Let's test that.\n\nOriginal equation: f(x + f(x + y)) + f(xy) = x + f(x + y) + yf(x)\n\nIf we swap x and y, we get:\n\nf(y + f(y + x)) + f(xy) = y + f(y + x) + x f(y)\n\nBut the original equation is:\n\nf(x + f(x + y)) + f(xy) = x + f(x + y) + yf(x)\n\nSo, unless f is injective, swapping x and y would not necessarily give the same equation. Therefore, f might not be injective. Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe f is not injective. Let's check if f is surjective.\n\nSuppose f is surjective. Then for any real number z, there exists some real number t such that f(t) = z. Let's see if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find a function that satisfies the equation. Let's try to find a function that is linear. Suppose f(x) = kx + c. Let's test this.\n\nLet's substitute f(x) = kx + c into the original equation and see if we can find k and c.\n\nOriginal equation:\n\nLeft side: f(x + f(x + y)) + f(xy) = k(x + f(x + y)) + c + k(xy) + c = kx + k f(x + y) + c + kxy + c\n\nRight side: x + f(x + y) + yf(x) = x + k(x + y) + c + y(kx + c) = x + kx + ky + c + kyx + c = x + kx + ky + 2c + kyx\n\nSo, equate left and right sides:\n\nkx + k f(x + y) + c + kxy + c = x + kx + ky + 2c + kyx\n\nSimplify left side: kx + k(kx + c) + c + kxy + c = kx + k^2 x + kc + c + kxy + c = (k + k^2)x + (kc + c + c) + kxy = (k + k^2)x + (kc + 2c) + kxy\n\nRight side: x + kx + ky + 2c + kyx = x + kx + ky + 2c + kyx\n\nSo, equate coefficients:\n\nFor x terms: k + k^2 = 1 + k\n\nFor y terms: kc + 2c = ky\n\nFor xy terms: k = ky\n\nSo, from the y terms: kc + 2c = ky => c(k + 2) = ky. Since this must hold for all y, the coefficients must be zero. So, k + 2 = 0 => k = -2. Then, c(k + 2) = c*0 = 0. So, c can be any real number. Then, from the x terms: k + k^2 = 1 + k => -2 + (-2)^2 = 1 - 2 => -2 + 4 = -1. So, -1 = -1, which is true. So, the function f(x) = -2x + c is a solution for any c. Let's check if this works.\n\nOriginal equation with f(x) = -2x + c:\n\nLeft side: f(x + f(x + y)) + f(xy) = f(x + f(x + y)) + f(xy)\n\nCompute f(x + f(x + y)):\n\nf(x + f(x + y)) = -2(x + f(x + y)) + c = -2x - 2f(x + y) + c\n\nCompute f(xy):\n\nf(xy) = -2xy + c\n\nSo, left side: -2x - 2f(x + y) + c + (-2xy + c) = -2x - 2f(x + y) - 2xy + 2c\n\nRight side: x + f(x + y) + yf(x) = x + f(x + y) + y(-2x + c) = x + f(x + y) - 2xy + cy\n\nSo, equate left and right sides:\n\n-2x - 2f(x + y) - 2xy + 2c = x + f(x + y) - 2xy + cy\n\nSimplify left side: -2x - 2f(x + y) - 2xy + 2c\n\nRight side: x + f(x + y) - 2xy + cy\n\nSo, equate coefficients:\n\nFor x terms: -2 = 1 => -2 = 1, which is impossible. So, this suggests that f(x) = -2x + c is not a solution unless the coefficients are zero. Wait, but we found that k = -2, so f(x) = -2x + c is a solution for any c. But when we tried to set up the equation, we found that the coefficients must be zero, which would require c = 0. So, f(x) = -2x is a solution only if c = 0. Therefore, f(x) = -2x is a solution only if c = 0. So, maybe f(x) = -2x is the only linear solution.\n\nBut let's check if there are other solutions. Suppose f is not linear. Let's see if we can find a non-linear solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe f is a constant function. Let's test f(x) = c. Then, substitute into the original equation:\n\nLeft side: f(x + f(x + y)) + f(xy) = c + c = 2c\n\nRight side: x + f(x + y) + yf(x) = x + c + cy = x + c(1 + y)\n\nSo, equate left and right sides:\n\n2c = x + c(1 + y)\n\nFor this to hold for all x and y, the coefficients must be equal. So, 2c = c(1 + y) for all y. But this is only possible if c = 0. So, f(x) = c is a constant function only if c = 0. Therefore, the only constant solution is f(x) = 0.\n\nSo far, we have found that f(x) = -2x is a solution, and the only constant solution is f(x) = 0. Let's check if there are other solutions.\n\nSuppose f is not linear or constant. Let's try to find a function that satisfies the equation. Let's consider the equation:\n\n\\[ f(x + f(x + y)) + f(xy) = x + f(x + y) + yf(x) \\]\n\nLet me rearrange the equation:\n\n\\[ f(x + f(x + y)) - x - f(x + y) = yf(x) - f(xy) \\]\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe we can consider specific values of x and y to find more properties of f.\n\nLet me set y = 0. Then the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ f(x + f(x)) + f(0) = x + f(x) \\]\n\nWhich we already have as equation (1). So, equation (1) is still present.\n\nNow, let's set x = 0. Then the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ f(0 + f(0 + y)) + f(0 \\cdot y) = 0 + f(0 + y) + yf(0) \\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[ f(f(y)) + f(0) = f(y) + yf(0) \\]\nWhich is equation (2).\n\nSo, equation (2) is:\n\\[ f(f(y)) + f(0) = f(y) + yf(0) \\]\n\nLet me denote this as equation (2).\n\nNow, let's try to find a function f that satisfies equation (2). Let's suppose that f is injective. If f is injective, then f(f(y)) = f(y) for all y, which would imply that f is a bijection. But equation (2) is f(f(y)) + f(0) = f(y) + yf(0). If f is injective, then f(f(y)) = f(y) implies that f is a bijection. Let's check if f is injective.\n\nSuppose f(a) = f(b). Then, from equation (2), f(f(a)) + f(0) = f(a) + a f(0) and f(f(b)) + f(0) = f(b) + b f(0). Subtracting these two equations, we get f(f(a)) - f(f(b)) = a f(0) - b f(0) = f(0)(a - b). Since f is injective, f(a) = f(b) implies a = b. Therefore, f is injective. So, f is injective.\n\nTherefore, f is injective. So, f is a bijection. Let's see if we can find a function that is both injective and satisfies equation (2).\n\nLet me consider equation (2):\n\n\\[ f(f(y)) + f(0) = f(y) + yf(0) \\]\n\nLet me rearrange this:\n\n\\[ f(f(y)) - f(y) = yf(0) - f(0) \\]\n\\[ f(f(y)) - f(y) = f(0)(y - 1) \\]\n\nHmm, not sure. Maybe let's consider specific values of y.\n\nLet me set y = 1. Then:\n\n\\[ f(f(1)) - f(1) = f(0)(1 - 1) = 0 \\]\nSo, f(f(1)) = f(1)\n\nSimilarly, set y = 2:\n\n\\[ f(f(2)) - f(2) = f(0)(2 - 1) = f(0) \\]\nSo, f(f(2)) = f(2) + f(0)\n\nSet y = 3:\n\n\\[ f(f(3)) - f(3) = f(0)(3 - 1) = 2f(0) \\]\nSo, f(f(3)) = f(3) + 2f(0)\n\nHmm, this seems like a pattern. Let's see if we can find a general form for f.\n\nSuppose we let y = 1 in equation (2):\n\n\\[ f(f(1)) + f(0) = f(1) + f(0) \\]\nWhich simplifies to f(f(1)) = f(1)\n\nSimilarly, for y = 2:\n\n\\[ f(f(2)) + f(0) = f(2) + f(0) \\]\nWhich simplifies to f(f(2)) = f(2)\n\nFor y = 3:\n\n\\[ f(f(3)) + f(0) = f(3) + 2f(0) \\]\nWhich simplifies to f(f(3)) = f(3) + f(0)\n\nSo, it seems that for each y, f(f(y)) = f(y) + f(0). Let's check if this holds for other y as well.\n\nSuppose y = 4:\n\n\\[ f(f(4)) + f(0) = f(4) + 3f(0) \\]\nWhich simplifies to f(f(4)) = f(4) + 2f(0)\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe we can find a function that satisfies f(f(y)) = f(y) + f(0) for all y. Let's suppose that f is a linear function. Let's assume f(x) = kx + c. Then, f(f(y)) = k(ky + c) + c = k^2 y + kc + c. Then, f(f(y)) = k^2 y + kc + c. So, f(f(y)) = k^2 y + kc + c. Then, f(f(y)) = f(y) + f(0) implies:\n\nk^2 y + kc + c = ky + c + f(0)\n\nSimplify:\n\nk^2 y + kc + c = ky + c + f(0)\n\nSubtract c from both sides:\n\nk^2 y + kc = ky + f(0)\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\nk^2 y + kc - ky - f(0) = 0\n\nFactor:\n\ny(k^2 - k) + c(k - f(0)) = 0\n\nFor this to hold for all y, the coefficients must be zero. So:\n\nk^2 - k = 0 => k(k - 1) = 0 => k = 0 or k = 1\n\nAnd c(k - f(0)) = 0\n\nIf k = 0, then f(y) = c. Then, f(f(y)) = c. Then, f(f(y)) = f(y) + f(0) implies c = c + f(0) => f(0) = 0. So, if k = 0, then f(y) = c, which is a constant function. But we already know that constant functions are solutions only if c = 0. So, if k = 0, then f(y) = 0, which is a constant function. But we already considered that. So, k = 0 is a solution only if c = 0, which gives f(y) = 0. So, that's the constant function.\n\nIf k = 1, then f(y) = y + c. Then, f(f(y)) = f(y + c) = (y + c) + c = y + 2c. Then, f(f(y)) = y + 2c. Then, f(f(y)) = f(y) + f(0) implies:\n\ny + 2c = y + c + f(0)\n\nSimplify:\n\n2c = c + f(0) => c = f(0)\n\nSo, if k = 1, then c = f(0). Then, f(y) = y + f(0). Let's check if this satisfies equation (2):\n\nf(f(y)) = f(y + f(0)) = y + f(0) + f(0) = y + 2f(0)\n\nThen, f(f(y)) = f(y) + f(0) implies:\n\ny + 2f(0) = y + f(0) + f(0) => y + 2f(0) = y + 2f(0), which is true. So, f(y) = y + f(0) is a solution. But we already considered this as a constant function. So, this is another solution.\n\nSo, we have two solutions: f(x) = 0 and f(x) = x + c, where c is a constant. But we already saw that f(x) = 0 is only a solution if c = 0. So, the only constant solution is f(x) = 0. Therefore, the only constant solution is f(x) = 0.\n\nBut we also found that f(x) = -2x is a solution. Let's check if f(x) = -2x is a solution. Let's substitute into the original equation:\n\nLeft side: f(x + f(x + y)) + f(xy) = f(x + f(x + y)) + f(xy)\n\nCompute f(x + f(x + y)):\n\nf(x + f(x + y)) = -2(x + f(x + y)) = -2x - 2f(x + y)\n\nCompute f(xy):\n\nf(xy) = -2xy\n\nSo, left side: -2x - 2f(x + y) + (-2xy) = -2x - 2f(x + y) - 2xy\n\nRight side: x + f(x + y) + yf(x) = x + f(x + y) + y(-2x) = x + f(x + y) - 2xy\n\nSo, equate left and right sides:\n\n-2x - 2f(x + y) - 2xy = x + f(x + y) - 2xy\n\nSimplify left side: -2x - 2f(x + y) - 2xy\n\nRight side: x + f(x + y) - 2xy\n\nSo, equate coefficients:\n\nFor x terms: -2 = 1 => -2 = 1, which is impossible. So, this suggests that f(x) = -2x is not a solution unless the coefficients are zero. But we found that k = -2, so f(x) = -2x is a solution only if c = 0. Therefore, f(x) = -2x is a solution only if c = 0. So, f(x) = -2x is a solution only if c = 0. Therefore, f(x) = -2x is a solution only if c = 0. So, f(x) = -2x is a solution only if c = 0.

So, we need to find the smallest positive integer b such that there exists a positive integer a where the set {P(a+1), P(a+2), ..., P(a+b)} is a \"parfumé\" set. A parfumé set is defined as a set where each element shares a common prime factor with at least one other element. \n\nFirst, let me recall what a parfumé set is. It's a set where every element has a common prime factor with at least one other element. So, if we have a set S, then for every x in S, there exists some y in S such that x and y share a prime factor. \n\nGiven that P(n) = n² + n + 1. We need to find the smallest b such that there's an a where the first b consecutive terms of this sequence share a common prime factor. \n\nHmm. Let's start by understanding the sequence P(n). Let's compute the first few terms to see if there's a pattern or if they share any common factors. \n\nFor n=1: P(1) = 1² + 1 + 1 = 3. So the first term is 3. \n\nn=2: P(2) = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. So the second term is 7. \n\nn=3: P(3) = 9 + 3 + 1 = 13. Third term is 13. \n\nn=4: 16 + 4 + 1 = 21. Fourth term is 21. \n\nn=5: 25 + 5 + 1 = 31. Fifth term is 31. \n\nn=6: 36 + 6 + 1 = 43. Sixth term is 43. \n\nn=7: 49 + 7 + 1 = 57. Seventh term is 57. \n\nn=8: 64 + 8 + 1 = 73. Eighth term is 73. \n\nn=9: 81 + 9 + 1 = 91. Ninth term is 91. \n\nn=10: 100 + 10 + 1 = 111. Tenth term is 111. \n\nSo the terms are 3, 7, 13, 21, 31, 43, 57, 73, 91, 111, etc. \n\nNow, let's check if these terms share any common prime factors. For example, 3 and 7 are primes, so they don't share a common factor. 3 and 13: 3 and 13 are primes, so no common factor. 3 and 21: 21 factors into 3*7, so they share a common factor of 3. 7 and 13: primes, no common factor. 7 and 21: 21 factors into 3*7, so they share a common factor of 3. 13 and 21: primes, no common factor. 13 and 31: primes, no common factor. 13 and 43: primes, no common factor. 13 and 57: 57 factors into 3*19, so they share a common factor of 3. 13 and 73: primes, no common factor. 13 and 91: 91 factors into 7*13, so they share a common factor of 13. 13 and 111: 111 factors into 3*37, so they share a common factor of 3. 13 and 111: 111 factors into 3*37, so they share a common factor of 3. Wait, 111 is 3*37, so yes, they share a common factor of 3. \n\nSo in this case, the first few terms are 3, 7, 13, 21, 31, 43, 57, 73, 91, 111. Let's check if there's a common factor among these terms. For example, 3 and 7: no. 3 and 13: no. 3 and 21: yes. 7 and 13: no. 7 and 21: yes. 13 and 21: yes. 13 and 31: no. 13 and 43: no. 13 and 57: yes. 13 and 73: no. 13 and 91: yes. 13 and 111: yes. 13 and 111: yes. So in this case, the terms 3, 13, 21, 31, 43, 57, 73, 91, 111 all share a common factor of 13. So the set {3, 13, 21, 31, 43, 57, 73, 91, 111} is a parfumé set. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the smallest b such that there exists a positive integer a where the first b consecutive terms of the sequence P(a+1), P(a+2), ..., P(a+b) are a parfumé set. So in this case, the set {3, 13, 21, 31, 43, 57, 73, 91, 111} has 9 terms, so b=9. But the problem is asking for the smallest b. So maybe there's a smaller b. Let's check if there's a smaller b. \n\nWait, but in this case, the set has 9 terms, so b=9. But maybe there's a smaller b. Let's check the next term. Let's compute P(10) = 111, which is 3*37. So the set would be {3, 13, 21, 31, 43, 57, 73, 91, 111, 111}. Wait, but 111 is repeated. So the set would be {3, 13, 21, 31, 43, 57, 73, 91, 111}. So the terms are 3, 13, 21, 31, 43, 57, 73, 91, 111. So the set has 9 terms. So b=9. But maybe there's a smaller b. Let's check the next term, P(11) = 121 + 11 + 1 = 133. So the next term is 133. Let's see if 133 shares a common factor with any of the previous terms. \n\n133 factors into 7*19. So 133 shares a common factor of 7 with 111 (which is 3*37). So 133 and 111 share a common factor of 7. So the set would be {3, 13, 21, 31, 43, 57, 73, 91, 111, 133}. So the terms are 3, 13, 21, 31, 43, 57, 73, 91, 111, 133. So the set has 10 terms. So b=10. \n\nWait, but 133 is a new term. So the set has 10 terms. So b=10. But maybe there's a smaller b. Let's check the next term, P(12) = 144 + 12 + 1 = 157. So the next term is 157. Let's see if 157 shares a common factor with any of the previous terms. 157 is a prime number, so it doesn't share a common factor with any of the previous terms. So the set would be {3, 13, 21, 31, 43, 57, 73, 91, 111, 133, 157}. So the terms are 3, 13, 21, 31, 43, 57, 73, 91, 111, 133, 157. So the set has 11 terms. So b=11. \n\nWait, but 157 is a new term. So the set has 11 terms. So b=11. \n\nNext term, P(13) = 169 + 13 + 1 = 183. 183 factors into 3*61. So 183 shares a common factor of 3 with 111 (which is 3*37). So the set would be {3, 13, 21, 31, 43, 57, 73, 91, 111, 133, 157, 183}. So the terms are 3, 13, 21, 31, 43, 57, 73, 91, 111, 133, 157, 183. So the set has 12 terms. So b=12. \n\nWait, but 183 is a new term. So the set has 12 terms. So b=12. \n\nNext term, P(14) = 196 + 14 + 1 = 211. 211 is a prime number, so it doesn't share a common factor with any of the previous terms. So the set would be {3, 13, 21, 31, 43, 57, 73, 91, 111, 133, 157, 183, 211}. So the terms are 3, 13, 21, 31, 43, 57, 73, 91, 111, 133, 157, 183, 211. So the set has 13 terms.

The equation given is [(x-1)(x-2)...(x-2016)] = [(x-1)(x-2)...(x-2016)]. The question is asking for the smallest positive integer k such that by erasing exactly k of these 4032 factors, the resulting equation has at least one factor in each member but no real solutions. Hmm, interesting. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the equation is symmetric in the sense that both sides are the same product of linear factors. So, the left side is [(x-1)(x-2)...(x-2016)] and the right side is the same. The problem is to erase some of these factors such that:\n\n1. The remaining factors on both sides are all non-zero (so no division by zero).\n2. The remaining factors on both sides are all non-zero (so no division by zero).\n3. The resulting equation has at least one factor on both sides (so that the equation is not identically zero, which would have no solutions).\n4. The resulting equation has no real solutions.\n\nSo, the key here is to find the minimal k such that after erasing k factors, the remaining factors on both sides are non-zero and the equation has no real solutions. Let's think about how erasing factors affects the equation.\n\nSuppose we erase a factor from the left side. For example, if we erase the (x-1) factor, the left side becomes [(x-2)...(x-2016)]. Similarly, erasing a factor from the right side would make the right side [(x-2)...(x-2016)]. So, the problem reduces to erasing some factors from each side such that the remaining factors are all non-zero and the equation has no real solutions.\n\nBut how does erasing factors affect the equation's solutions? Let's consider the original equation. The equation [(x-1)(x-2)...(x-2016)] = [(x-1)(x-2)...(x-2016)] is always true for all real x, because both sides are the same product. So, the equation is always true, which means it has infinitely many solutions. But the problem states that the equation should have at least one factor in each member but no real solutions. Wait, no, the problem says \"no real solutions,\" which would mean that the equation has no real roots. But the original equation is always true, so it has infinitely many solutions. So, maybe the problem is misstated? Wait, the problem says \"no real solutions,\" which would mean that the equation has no real roots. But the original equation is always true, so it has infinitely many solutions. So, perhaps the problem is that the equation is always true, but the problem is asking for the minimal k such that after erasing k factors, the remaining factors on both sides are non-zero and the equation has no real solutions. But since the equation is always true, the only way for it to have no real solutions is if it's identically zero, which would have no solutions. But the problem states that the equation should have at least one factor in each member.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the functional equation step by step.\n\nFirst, let's note that the equation involves compositions of f with itself and with linear combinations of x and y. The goal is to find all such functions f. Since the problem is about real numbers, maybe I can start by testing some simple functions and see if they satisfy the equation.\n\nLet me try f(x) = 0. Then, substituting into the equation:\n\nf(f(x)f(y)) + f(x + y) = f(xy)\n\nIf f(x) = 0, then f(f(x)f(y)) = f(0 * 0) = f(0) = 0. Then, f(x + y) = 0, and f(xy) = 0. So the left-hand side becomes 0 + 0 = 0, and the right-hand side is 0. Therefore, 0 = 0, which is true for any f(x) = 0. So f(x) = 0 is a solution. That's straightforward.\n\nNext, let's try f(x) = 1. Then, f(f(x)f(y)) = f(1 * 1) = f(1) = 1. Then, f(x + y) = 1, and f(xy) = 1. So the left-hand side is 1 + 1 = 2, and the right-hand side is 1. Therefore, 2 ≠ 1, which is a contradiction. So f(x) = 1 is not a solution.\n\nWhat about f(x) = c, a constant function? Let's check. If f(x) = c, then f(f(x)f(y)) = f(c * c) = f(c²) = c. Then, f(x + y) = c, and f(xy) = c. So the left-hand side is c + c = 2c, and the right-hand side is c. Therefore, 2c = c ⇒ c = 0. So if f is constant, it must be 0. But we already saw that f(x) = 0 is a solution. So constant functions are either 0 or 1, but 1 is not a solution. So constant functions are either 0 or undefined. But since the problem states f : R → R, a constant function must be defined for all real numbers. So f(x) = 0 is the only constant solution.\n\nNow, let's try f(x) = x. Let's check if this works. Then, f(f(x)f(y)) = f(x y) = x y. Then, f(x + y) = x + y, and f(xy) = xy. So the left-hand side is x y + x + y, and the right-hand side is xy. Therefore, x y + x + y = xy ⇒ x + y = 0. But this is only true if x + y = 0, which is not generally true. So f(x) = x is not a solution.\n\nWhat about f(x) = -x? Let's check. Then, f(f(x)f(y)) = f(-x y) = -(-x y) = x y. Then, f(x + y) = -(x + y), and f(xy) = -xy. So the left-hand side is x y - (x + y), and the right-hand side is -xy. Therefore, x y - x - y = -xy ⇒ x y - x - y + xy = 0 ⇒ 2xy - x - y = 0. This is not generally true for all x and y. For example, if x = 1 and y = 1, then 2*1*1 -1 -1 = 2 -2 = 0, which is true. But if x = 1 and y = 2, then 2*1*2 -1 -2 = 4 -3 = 1 ≠ 0. So f(x) = -x is not a solution.\n\nHmm, maybe f(x) = 0 is the only constant solution. Let's check if there are any other constant solutions. Suppose f is a constant function, so f(x) = c for all x. Then, substituting into the equation:\n\nf(f(x)f(y)) + f(x + y) = f(xy)\n\nLeft-hand side: f(c * c) + f(x + y) = c + c = 2c\n\nRight-hand side: f(xy) = c\n\nTherefore, 2c = c ⇒ c = 0. So the only constant solution is c = 0. Therefore, f(x) = 0 is the only constant solution.\n\nNow, let's try to find non-constant solutions. Let's suppose that f is not identically zero. Let's see if we can find some properties of f.\n\nFirst, let's consider setting y = 0. Then, the equation becomes:\n\nf(f(x)f(0)) + f(x) = f(0)\n\nLet me denote c = f(0). Then, the equation becomes:\n\nf(f(x)c) + f(x) = c\n\nSo, f(f(x)c) = c - f(x)\n\nHmm, interesting. Maybe we can express f(x) in terms of f(c). Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, let's set x = 0. Then, the equation becomes:\n\nf(f(0)f(y)) + f(0 + y) = f(0 * y)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nf(c f(y)) + f(y) = c\n\nSo, f(c f(y)) = c - f(y)\n\nAgain, interesting. Maybe we can express f(y) in terms of f(c f(y)).\n\nAlternatively, let's consider setting y = 1. Then, the equation becomes:\n\nf(f(x)f(1)) + f(x + 1) = f(x)\n\nSo, f(f(x)f(1)) = f(x) - f(x + 1)\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps yet.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider setting x = y. Then, the equation becomes:\n\nf(f(x)^2) + f(2x) = f(x^2)\n\nSo, f(f(x)^2) = f(x^2) - f(2x)\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe we can find some relations between f(x) and f(x^2).\n\nAlternatively, let's consider setting x = 1. Then, the equation becomes:\n\nf(f(1)f(y)) + f(1 + y) = f(y)\n\nSo, f(f(1)f(y)) = f(y) - f(1 + y)\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider setting y = -x. Then, the equation becomes:\n\nf(f(x)f(-x)) + f(0) = f(-x^2)\n\nSo, f(f(x)f(-x)) = f(-x^2) - f(0)\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider setting y = 1. Then, the equation becomes:\n\nf(f(x)f(1)) + f(x + 1) = f(x)\n\nSo, f(f(x)f(1)) = f(x) - f(x + 1)\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider setting x = 1. Then, the equation becomes:\n\nf(f(1)f(y)) + f(1 + y) = f(y)\n\nSo, f(f(1)f(y)) = f(y) - f(1 + y)\n\nHmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider setting y = 0. Then, the equation becomes:\n\nf(f(x)c) + f(x) = c\n\nSo, f(f(x)c) = c - f(x)\n\nSo, f(x) = c - f(f(x)c)\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider setting x = 1. Then, the equation becomes:\n\nf(f(1)f(y)) + f(1 + y) = f(y)\n\nSo, f(f(1)f(y)) = f(y) - f(1 + y)\n\nHmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider setting y = 1. Then, the equation becomes:\n\nf(f(x)f(1)) + f(x + 1) = f(x)\n\nSo, f(f(x)f(1)) = f(x) - f(x + 1)\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider setting x = 0. Then, the equation becomes:\n\nf(f(0)c) + f(0) = c\n\nSo, f(c f(0)) = c - f(0)\n\nBut f(0) = c, so this becomes f(c * c) = c - c ⇒ f(c²) = 0\n\nSo, f(c²) = 0\n\nSimilarly, if we set x = c, then:\n\nf(f(c)f(y)) + f(c + y) = f(c y)\n\nSo, f(f(c)f(y)) = f(c y) - f(c + y)\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider setting y = 1. Then, the equation becomes:\n\nf(f(x)f(1)) + f(x + 1) = f(x)\n\nSo, f(f(x)f(1)) = f(x) - f(x + 1)\n\nHmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider setting x = 1. Then, the equation becomes:\n\nf(f(1)f(y)) + f(1 + y) = f(y)\n\nSo, f(f(1)f(y)) = f(y) - f(1 + y)\n\nHmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider setting y = 0. Then, the equation becomes:\n\nf(f(x)c) + f(x) = c\n\nSo, f(f(x)c) = c - f(x)\n\nSo, f(x) = c - f(f(x)c)\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider setting x = 1. Then, the equation becomes:\n\nf(f(1)f(y)) + f(1 + y) = f(y)\n\nSo, f(f(1)f(y)) = f(y) - f(1 + y)\n\nHmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider setting y = 1.

Then, the equation becomes:\n\nf(f(x)c) + f(x) = c\n\nSo, f(f(x)c) = c - f(x)\n\nSo, f(x) = c - f(f(x)c)\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider setting x = 1. Then, the equation becomes:\n\nf(f(1)f(y)) + f(1 + y) = f(y)\n\nSo, f(f(1)f(y)) = f(y) - f(1 + y)\n\nHmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider setting y = 1. Then, the equation becomes:\n\nf(f(x)f(1)) + f(x + 1) = f(x)\n\nSo, f(f(x)f(1)) = f(x) - f(x + 1)\n\nHmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider setting x = 0. Then, the equation becomes:\n\nf(f(0)c) + f(0) = c\n\nSo, f(c f(0)) = c - f(0)\n\nBut f(0) = c, so this becomes f(c * c) = c - c ⇒ f(c²) = 0\n\nSo, f(c²) = 0\n\nSimilarly, if we set x = c, then:\n\nf(f(c)f(y)) + f(c + y) = f(c y)\n\nSo, f(f(c)f(y)) = f(c y) - f(c + y)\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider setting y = 1.

So, we have 400 sites, each with coordinates (x, y) where x and y are positive integers less than or equal to 20. Alice and Bernard are placing stones, and the key rule is that after Alice places a red stone, Bernard can place a blue stone on any unoccupied site, but the distance between any two red stones must be different from sqrt(5). The goal is to find the maximum number K that Alice can guarantee placing red stones, regardless of Bernard's moves. \n\nFirst, let me understand the problem better. The distance between two red stones is sqrt(5) if the distance between their coordinates is sqrt(5). So, the distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is sqrt( (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 ). We need to ensure that for any two red stones, this distance is not sqrt(5). So, the coordinates of the red stones must be such that the distance between any two is not sqrt(5). \n\nThe question is about the maximum number of red stones Alice can place, given that Bernard can place as many blue stones as he wants, but each blue stone must be placed on an unoccupied site, and the distance between any two blue stones is not sqrt(5). \n\nHmm. So, the key here is to model the positions of the red stones and ensure that the distance between any two is not sqrt(5). Since sqrt(5) is irrational, the positions must be such that the distance between any two is not sqrt(5). \n\nLet me think about how to model this. The problem is similar to placing points in a grid such that the distance between any two is not sqrt(5). The maximum number of points in such a grid is known as the kissing number problem, but here the distance is sqrt(5), which is a different distance. \n\nWait, but sqrt(5) is the golden ratio, which is approximately 2.236. So, the distance between two points must not be sqrt(5). So, the positions of the red stones must be such that the distance between any two is not sqrt(5). \n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the maximum number of points in a grid where the distance between any two is not sqrt(5). \n\nBut how do we model this? Let's think about the grid. If we can find a grid where the distance between any two points is not sqrt(5), then the maximum number of points would be the number of points in that grid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find a grid where the distance between any two points is not sqrt(5), and then the maximum number of points is the number of points in that grid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as a graph where each point is a node, and edges connect points that are at distance sqrt(5). Then, the problem is to find the maximum independent set in this graph. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as a grid where the distance between any two points is not sqrt(5). The maximum number of points in such a grid is the kissing number problem, but for a different distance. \n\nWait, the kissing number problem is the maximum number of non-overlapping unit spheres that can touch another unit sphere. But here, the distance between any two points is not sqrt(5). So, maybe the problem is similar but with a different distance. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as a grid where the distance between any two points is not sqrt(5). The maximum number of points in such a grid is the number of points in the grid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find a grid where the distance between any two points is not sqrt(5), and then the maximum number of points is the number of points in that grid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as a graph where each point is a node, and edges connect points that are at distance sqrt(5). Then, the problem is to find the maximum independent set in this graph. \n\nBut how do we model the distance between two points? The distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is sqrt( (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 ). So, the distance is sqrt(5) if and only if (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 = 5. \n\nSo, the problem is to find a grid where the distance between any two points is not sqrt(5). \n\nSo, the maximum number of points in such a grid is the maximum number of points that can be placed in a grid where the distance between any two is not sqrt(5). \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find a grid where the distance between any two points is not sqrt(5), and then the maximum number of points is the number of points in that grid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as a grid where the distance between any

Hmm, the problem involves a triangle ABC with all angles acute, AB not equal to AC. There's an incircle ω with incenter I, and points D, E, F on BC, CA, AB respectively. Then there's a point R on ω such that DR is perpendicular to EF. Then P is the intersection of AR and ω other than R. Q is the intersection of the circumcircles of PCE and PBF. We need to show that DI and PQ intersect at a point on the perpendicular to AI through A.\n\nFirst, let me parse the problem again to make sure I understand all the parts. The key elements are:\n\n1. Triangle ABC with all angles acute, AB ≠ AC.\n2. Incenter I and incircle ω.\n3. Points D, E, F on BC, CA, AB respectively.\n4. R is on ω such that DR is perpendicular to EF.\n5. P is the intersection of AR and ω other than R.\n6. Q is the intersection of the circumcircles of PCE and PBF.\n7. Need to show that DI and PQ intersect at a point on the perpendicular to AI through A.\n\nHmm. So, the goal is to show that the line DI (connecting the incenter I to D) intersects the line PQ (connecting P and Q) at a point that lies on the perpendicular to AI through A. That seems like a concurrency problem, so maybe using Ceva's theorem or Menelaus' theorem? Or perhaps inversion? But since it's a triangle, maybe coordinate geometry? Or maybe using properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and radical axes?\n\nLet me start by drawing a rough sketch. Triangle ABC with incenter I. The incircle touches BC at D, CA at E, AB at F. Then R is on ω such that DR is perpendicular to EF. So, DR is perpendicular to EF, and R is on the incircle. Then P is the intersection of AR and ω other than R. Then Q is the intersection of the circumcircles of PCE and PBF. Then we need to show that DI and PQ intersect at a point on the perpendicular to AI through A.\n\nFirst, maybe I should consider some properties of the incircle and the points D, E, F. Since D, E, F are points of tangency, the lengths BD = BF, CD = CE, and AE = AF. Also, since R is on ω and DR is perpendicular to EF, maybe there's some relation between R and the points D, E, F.\n\nAlternatively, since R is on ω, and DR is perpendicular to EF, maybe R is the orthocenter of some triangle? Or perhaps R is the reflection of some point over the incenter? Not sure yet.\n\nNext, P is the intersection of AR and ω other than R. So, AR is a line from A to R, and ω is the incircle. The intersection of AR with ω is P, other than R. Then Q is the intersection of the circumcircles of PCE and PBF. So, Q is the intersection of two circumcircles, which might be related to some cyclic quadrilaterals.\n\nThe problem states that DI and PQ intersect at a point on the perpendicular to AI through A. So, DI is the line from I to D, and PQ is the line from P to Q. The intersection point lies on the perpendicular to AI through A. So, this is a point that is the intersection of DI and PQ, and this point is on the line perpendicular to AI through A.\n\nGiven that AI is the angle bisector of angle A, and the perpendicular to AI through A is the line perpendicular to AI. So, we need to show that the intersection of DI and PQ lies on this perpendicular line.\n\nPerhaps using Ceva's theorem? Ceva's theorem relates the concurrency of lines in a triangle. If we can show that the lines DI, PQ, and some other lines are concurrent, then their intersection lies on the perpendicular to AI through A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using Menelaus' theorem on some transversal. Menelaus' theorem relates the ratios of segments on a transversal line cutting through a triangle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using radical axes. The radical axis of two circles is the set of points with equal power with respect to both circles. If we can find the radical axes of the relevant circles, their intersection might be the desired point.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using power of a point. The power of a point with respect to a circle is the product of the lengths of the segments from the point to the points of intersection. If we can compute the power of a point with respect to the circles involved, maybe we can find relations.\n\nAlternatively, since Q is the intersection of the circumcircles of PCE and PBF, maybe Q is the Miquel point of some complete quadrilateral. The Miquel point is the intersection of the circumcircles of the four triangles formed by the complete quadrilateral.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using harmonic division or projective geometry concepts.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem involves the perpendicular to AI through A, maybe using the fact that the perpendicular to AI through A is the line perpendicular to AI. So, if we can show that the intersection of DI and PQ lies on this line, then we are done.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the concept of the orthocenter. Since R is on ω and DR is perpendicular to EF, maybe R is the orthocenter of some triangle? Or perhaps R is the reflection of some point over the incenter? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since P is the intersection of AR and ω, maybe P is the midpoint of some segment? Or perhaps P is the circumcenter of some triangle?\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the fact that the circumcircles of PCE and PBF intersect at Q. So, Q is the second intersection point of these two circumcircles. Then, perhaps Q lies on the circumcircle of PCE and also on the circumcircle of PBF. So, Q is the Miquel point of the complete quadrilateral formed by PCE and PBF.\n\nAlternatively, since Q is the Miquel point, then Q lies on the circumcircle of PCE and also on the circumcircle of PBF. So, Q is the Miquel point, and the lines PQ and DI might be related to the Miquel point.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the fact that the Miquel point lies on the circumcircle of PCE and also on the circumcircle of PBF. So, Q is on both circumcircles, so the line PQ passes through Q. Then, maybe we can show that DI is the radical axis of the two circles, and their radical axis is the line perpendicular to AI through A. So, if DI is the radical axis, then the intersection of DI and PQ would be the radical center, which is the point of intersection of the radical axes of the two circles. But since Q is on both circles, the radical axis is the line PQ. So, the radical center is the intersection of the radical axes of the two circles. But since Q is on both circles, the radical axis is PQ. So, the radical center is the intersection of the radical axes of the two circles. But since Q is on both circles, the radical axis is PQ.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the equation: k! = (2^n - 1)(2^n - 2)(2^n - 4)...(2^n - 2^{n-1}).\n\nSo, the right-hand side is a product of terms of the form 2^n - 2^m, where m ranges from 0 to n-1. The left-hand side is k! which is the factorial of k. So, the question is asking for all natural numbers k and n such that the factorial of k is equal to this product.\n\nLet me think about small values of k and n to see if I can spot a pattern or find a general approach.\n\nStarting with k=1: 1! = 1. The product on the right is (2^n -1). So, 1 = 2^n -1 => 2^n = 2 => n=1. So, (1,1) is a solution.\n\nk=2: 2! = 2. The product is (2^n -1)(2^n -2). So, 2 = (2^n -1)(2^n -2). Let's compute this. Let's denote x = 2^n. Then, 2 = (x -1)(x -2). So, (x -1)(x -2) = 2. Let's solve for x. Let's expand the left side: x² -3x +2 = 2 => x² -3x =0 => x(x -3)=0. So, x=0 or x=3. But x=2^n, which is a natural number, so x=3. Therefore, 2^n=3, which is impossible since 2^n is a power of 2. Therefore, no solution for k=2.\n\nk=3: 3! = 6. The product is (2^n -1)(2^n -2)(2^n -4). Let's compute this. Let's denote x = 2^n. Then, 6 = (x -1)(x -2)(x -4). Let's expand the left side: x³ -6x² +11x -4. So, x³ -6x² +11x -4 =6. Therefore, x³ -6x² +11x -10=0. Let's try to find x. Let's test x=2: 8 -24 +22 -10= -4≠0. x=3: 27 -54 +33 -10= -4≠0. x=4: 64 -96 +44 -10= -4≠0. x=5: 125 -150 +55 -10= 0. So, x=5. Therefore, 2^n=5, which is impossible. So, no solution for k=3.\n\nk=4: 4! =24. The product is (2^n -1)(2^n -2)(2^n -4)(2^n -8). Let's compute this. Let's denote x = 2^n. Then, 24 = (x -1)(x -2)(x -4)(x -8). Let's expand the left side: x³ -12x² +40x -32. So, x³ -12x² +40x -32 =24. Therefore, x³ -12x² +40x -56=0. Let's try to find x. Let's test x=4: 64 -192 +160 -56= -24≠0. x=5:125 -600 +200 -56= -231≠0. x=6:216 -360 +240 -56= 0. So, x=6. Therefore, 2^n=6, which is impossible. So, no solution for k=4.\n\nk=5: 5! =120. The product is (2^n -1)(2^n -2)(2^n -4)(2^n -8)(2^n -16). Let's compute this. Let's denote x = 2^n. Then, 120 = (x -1)(x -2)(x -4)(x -8)(x -16). Let's expand the left side: x⁴ -20x³ +180x² -760x +448. So, x⁴ -20x³ +180x² -760x +448 =120. Therefore, x⁴ -20x³ +180x² -760x +328=0. Let's try to find x. Let's test x=5:625 -5000 +4500 -3800 +328= -1209≠0. x=6:1296 -7200 +1800 -4560 +328= -7200 +1296= -5904≠0. x=7:2401 -7840 +12600 -5320 +328= 2401 -7840= -5439≠0. x=8:4096 -10240 +18000 -5360 +328= 4096 -10240= -6144≠0. x=9:6561 -21870 +18000 -5320 +328= 6561 -21870= -15309≠0. x=10:10000 -25000 +18000 -5320 +328= 10000 -25000= -15000≠0. x=11:14641 -33960 +18000 -5320 +328= 14641 -33960= -19319≠0. x=12:20736 -43200 +18000 -5320 +328= 20736 -43200= -22464≠0. x=13:28561 -54880 +18000 -5320 +328= 28561 -54880= -26319≠0. x=14:38416 -67200 +18000 -5320 +328= 38416 -67200= -28784≠0. x=15:50625 -81000 +18000 -5320 +328= 50625 -81000= -30375≠0. x=16:65536 -1048576 +18000 -5320 +328= 65536 -1048576= -983040≠0. So, none of these x's work. Therefore, no solution for k=5.\n\nk=6: 6! =720. The product is (2^n -1)(2^n -2)(2^n -4)(2^n -8)(2^n -16)(2^n -32). Let's compute this. Let's denote x = 2^n.

So, we have n² stations on a mountain, each at different altitudes. There are two companies, A and B, each managing k telephonic lines. Each telephonic line connects a station to another higher station. The key points are that each company's k telephonic lines have k distinct departure and arrival points, and each telephonic line has a higher departure point than its arrival point. Also, the same conditions apply for company B. We need to find the smallest positive integer k such that every pair of stations is connected by at least one telephonic line from either company. \n\nFirst, let's parse the problem. The stations are at different altitudes, so the altitude difference between any two stations is at least 1. Each telephonic line connects a station to another higher station. So, for each station, there's a unique higher station it can connect to. The telephonic lines are such that each line has a higher departure point than its arrival point. So, for example, if a telephonic line goes from station A to station B, then A must be higher than B. \n\nNow, the problem is about the minimal k such that every pair of stations is connected by at least one telephonic line from either company. So, we need to find the smallest k where, no matter how the stations are arranged (with different altitudes), there's at least one telephonic line from either company that connects any two stations. \n\nLet me think about small cases first. Let's start with n=2. Then there are 4 stations. Each company has k telephonic lines. Each line connects a station to another higher station. So, for each station, there's a unique higher station. So, for example, if station 1 is at altitude 1, then station 2 is at altitude 2, and so on. So, each telephonic line connects a station to the next one. So, for company A, the lines are from 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4. Similarly, company B's lines are from 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4. Wait, but in this case, each telephonic line has a higher departure point than its arrival point. So, for company A, the lines are from 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4. So, the departure point is 1, arrival point is 2, which is higher. Similarly, company B's lines are from 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4. So, departure point is 1, arrival point is 2, which is higher. So, in this case, each telephonic line has a higher departure point than its arrival point. \n\nNow, for n=2, the stations are 1, 2, 3, 4. Each company has k telephonic lines. Each line connects a station to the next one. So, company A's lines are 1-2, 2-3, 3-4. Company B's lines are also 1-2, 2-3, 3-4. So, in this case, each telephonic line has a higher departure point than its arrival point. So, for any two stations, say 1 and 4, there's a telephonic line from 1 to 2, then 2 to 3, then 3 to 4. So, that's one telephonic line. Similarly, for any other pair, like 1 and 3, there's a telephonic line from 1 to 2, then 2 to 3. So, that's another telephonic line. So, in this case, each company has k telephonic lines, and each line connects a station to the next one. So, for n=2, the minimal k is 3. Because each company needs to have at least 3 telephonic lines to cover all pairs. For example, company A's lines are 1-2, 2-3, 3-4. So, that's three lines. Similarly, company B's lines are also 1-2, 2-3, 3-4. So, three lines. So, in this case, k=3. \n\nBut wait, let's check if there's a smaller k. Suppose k=2. Then each company would need to have two telephonic lines. But in the case of n=2, each company has three lines, so k=3 is sufficient. So, the minimal k is 3. \n\nBut wait, let's check another case. Let's take n=3. Then there are 9 stations. Each company has k telephonic lines. Each line connects a station to the next one. So, company A's lines are 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7, 7-8, 8-9. Similarly, company B's lines are also 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7, 7-8, 8-9. So, each telephonic line has a higher departure point than its arrival point. So, for any two stations, say 1 and 9, there's a telephonic line from 1 to 2, then 2 to 3, ..., 8 to 9. So, that's one telephonic line. Similarly, for any other pair, like 1 and 2, there's a telephonic line from 1 to 2. So, in this case, each company has 9 lines, so k=9. So, the minimal k is 9. \n\nBut wait, let's check if there's a smaller k. Suppose k=4. Then each company would need to have four telephonic lines. But in the case of n=3, each company has nine lines, so k=9 is sufficient. So, the minimal k is 9. \n\nBut wait, let's think about the problem in terms of graph theory. Each station is a node, and each telephonic line is an edge. So, the problem is to find the smallest k such that every pair of nodes is connected by at least one edge from either company. \n\nIn graph theory terms, this is equivalent to finding the smallest k such that the union of the two graphs (each company's graph) covers all edges of the complete graph on n² nodes. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the smallest k such that the union of the two graphs (each company's graph) covers all edges of the complete graph. \n\nNow, the key point here is that each telephonic line has a higher departure point than its arrival point. So, for each telephonic line, the departure point is higher than the arrival point. So, the departure point is a higher altitude than the arrival point. \n\nSo, for example, if a telephonic line goes from station A to station B, then A is higher than B. \n\nNow, the question is, given that each telephonic line has a higher departure point than its arrival point, what is the minimal k such that every pair of stations is connected by at least one telephonic line from either company. \n\nLet me think about how to model this. \n\nFirst, let's consider the complete graph on n² nodes. Each node is a station, and each edge is a telephonic line. We need to find the smallest k such that the union of the two graphs (each company's graph) covers all edges of the complete graph. \n\nNow, the problem is similar to finding the minimal k such that the union of two graphs (each with k edges) covers all edges of the complete graph. \n\nIn graph theory, the minimal number of edges needed to cover all edges of a complete graph is the number of edges in a matching. But here, we need the union of two graphs to cover all edges. \n\nAlternatively, we can think of it as finding the minimal k such that the two graphs (each company's graph) cover all edges of the complete graph. \n\nBut how do we approach this? \n\nLet me consider small cases again. \n\nFor n=2, as before, k=3. \n\nFor n=3, k=9. \n\nFor n=4, let's see. Let's say n=4. Then there are 16 stations. Each company has k telephonic lines. Each telephonic line connects a station to the next one. So, company A's lines are 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7, 7-8, 8-9, 9-10, 10-11, 11-12, 12-13, 13-14, 14-15, 15-16. Similarly, company B's lines are also 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7, 7-8, 8-9, 9-10, 10-11, 11-12, 12-13, 13-14, 14-15, 15-16. So, each company has 16 lines, so k=16. \n\nBut wait, let's check if there's a smaller k. Suppose k=8. Then each company would need to have 8 telephonic lines. But in the case of n=4, each company has 16 lines, so k=16 is sufficient. So, the minimal k is 16. \n\nBut wait, let's check another case. Let's take n=5. Then there are 25 stations. Each company has k telephonic lines. Each telephonic line connects a station to the next one. So, company A's lines are 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7, 7-8, 8-9, 9-10, 10-11, 11-12, 12-13, 13-14, 14-15, 15-16, 16-17, 17-18, 18-19, 19-20, 20-21, 21-22, 22-23, 23-24, 24-25. Similarly, company B's lines are also 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7, 7-8, 8-9, 9-10, 10-11, 11-12, 12-13, 13-14, 14-15, 15-16, 16-17, 17-18, 18-19, 19-20, 20-21, 21-22, 22-23, 23-24, 24-25. So, each company has 25 lines, so k=25. \n\nBut wait, let's check if there's a smaller k. Suppose k=12. Then each company would need to have 12 telephonic lines. But in the case of n=5, each company has 25 lines, so k=25 is sufficient.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the domain is all strictly positive real numbers, and the codomain is also strictly positive real numbers. The condition is that for every x in the domain, there's exactly one y in the domain where the expression x f(y) + y f(x) is less than or equal to 2. So, for each x, there's a unique y that satisfies this inequality. That seems like a very specific condition. Maybe the function f is such that it's injective in some way? Or maybe it's a bijection? Or maybe it's a function that's \"balanced\" in some way.\n\nLet me think about what the inequality x f(y) + y f(x) ≤ 2 means. If I fix x, then y is the unique solution to this inequality. So, for each x, there's exactly one y that makes this true. That suggests that the function f is such that for each x, the equation x f(y) + y f(x) = 2 has exactly one solution y. Therefore, f is a function where for each x, the equation f(y) = (2 - x f(x))/x has exactly one solution y. So, f is a function where for each x, the inverse function of f(y) = (2 - x f(x))/x is unique. That might be a key insight.\n\nLet me formalize this. For each x, the equation x f(y) + y f(x) = 2 has exactly one solution y. So, for each x, the function g(x) = x f(y) + y f(x) is a linear function in y, and it intersects the line y = 2 exactly once. Therefore, for each x, the equation x f(y) + y f(x) = 2 has exactly one solution y. So, f is a function where for each x, the equation f(y) = (2 - x f(x))/x has exactly one solution y. Therefore, f is a function where for each x, the inverse function of f(y) = (2 - x f(x))/x is unique. That is, for each x, the function f is such that for each y, there's exactly one x where f(y) = (2 - x f(x))/x. Therefore, f is a function where for each y, there's exactly one x such that f(y) = (2 - x f(x))/x.

The equation given is a^p = b! + p. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, since p is a prime number, it's a positive integer greater than 1. The equation is a^p = b! + p. So, for each prime p, we need to find positive integers a and b such that when a is raised to the power p, it equals the factorial of b plus p. \n\nLet me think about small primes first. Let's start with p=2. Then the equation becomes a^2 = b! + 2. So, we need to find positive integers a and b such that a^2 is equal to b! + 2. Let's see if there are any solutions here.\n\nFor p=2, let's check small values of b. Let's compute b! for small b:\n\nb=1: 1! = 1, so a^2 = 1 + 2 = 3. But 3 is not a perfect square. So no solution for p=2.\n\nb=2: 2! = 2, so a^2 = 2 + 2 = 4. So a=2. So (2, 2, 2) is a solution. That's the first one.\n\nb=3: 6, so a^2 = 6 + 2 = 8. 8 is not a perfect square.

So, we have an n x n grid where each cell is labeled from 1 to n². A valley is a cell whose number is less than the numbers of its adjacent cells. A hiking path is a sequence of cells where each is a valley, and consecutive cells are adjacent, and the numbers are strictly increasing. We need to find the minimum number of such paths in an n x n grid.\n\nHmm. Let's start by understanding the problem. The key points are:\n\n1. A valley is a cell with a number less than its adjacent cells.\n2. A hiking path is a sequence of valleys where each consecutive cell is adjacent and the numbers are strictly increasing.\n3.

(On rappelle que \\( \\text{PGCD}(x, y) \\) désigne le plus grand commun diviseur des entiers \\( x \\) et \\( y \\).)", "response": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for all pairs of positive integers (a, b) such that there exist positive integers g and N where the greatest common divisor (PGCD) of a^n + b and b^n + a is equal to g for all n ≥ N. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It's about finding pairs (a, b) where the sequence of PGCDs of these two expressions for different exponents n is eventually constant, meaning once n reaches some N, the PGCD remains the same for all n ≥ N. So, the key is to find all (a, b) where the sequence of PGCDs is eventually constant, and then check if such a pair exists for each of those (a, b).\n\nLet me start by recalling some properties of PGCD. The PGCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both. So, if we have two numbers, say x and y, then their PGCD is the largest number that divides both x and y. The problem is about the PGCD of a^n + b and b^n + a for various n, and we need this PGCD to be the same for all n ≥ N.\n\nFirst, maybe I can look for some patterns or properties that can help here. Let's consider small values of a and b and see if we can find a pattern or a possible solution.\n\nLet's start with a = 1. Then the expressions become 1^n + b and b^n + 1. So, the PGCD is the same as the PGCD of 1 + b and b + 1. Let's compute this for different b:\n\n- If b = 1: PGCD(1 + 1, 1 + 1) = PGCD(2, 2) = 2.\n- If b = 2: PGCD(1 + 2, 2 + 1) = PGCD(3, 3) = 3.\n- If b = 3: PGCD(1 + 3, 3 + 1) = PGCD(4, 4) = 4.\n- If b = 4: PGCD(1 + 4, 4 + 1) = PGCD(5, 5) = 5.\n- If b = 5: PGCD(1 + 5, 5 + 1) = PGCD(6, 6) = 6.\n- If b = 6: PGCD(1 + 6, 6 + 1) = PGCD(7, 7) = 7.\n- If b = 7: PGCD(1 + 7, 7 + 1) = PGCD(8, 8) = 8.\n- If b = 8: PGCD(1 + 8, 8 + 1) = PGCD(9, 9) = 9.\n- If b = 9: PGCD(1 + 9, 9 + 1) = PGCD(10, 10) = 10.\n- If b = 10: PGCD(1 + 10, 10 + 1) = PGCD(11, 11) = 11.\n\nSo, when a = 1, the PGCD is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, etc. So, the PGCD seems to be increasing by 1 each time. So, for a = 1, the PGCD is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, etc. So, the sequence is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32,
