Find the maximum number of isosceles triangles having two good sides that could appear in such a configuration. ", "response": "To solve the problem, we need to understand the properties of the good diagonals and sides in a regular 2006-gon. A diagonal is called good if its endpoints divide the boundary of the polygon into two parts, each composed of an odd number of sides. This means that if we label the vertices of the 2006-gon as \\(1, 2, \\ldots, 2006\\), a diagonal from vertex \\(i\\) to vertex \\(j\\) is good if and only if \\(|i-j| \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}\\) and the number of sides between \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) (excluding \\(i\\) and \\(j\\)) is odd. This implies that the diagonal connects a vertex to a vertex that is an odd number of steps away, and the number of sides between them is odd.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of good diagonals. For each vertex \\(i\\), there are exactly 1003 vertices that are an odd number of steps away (since 2006 is even, the number of such vertices is half of the total number of vertices minus one, i.e., 1003). However, we need to exclude the sides of the polygon, which are also considered good. There are 2006 sides, so the total number of good diagonals is \\(2006 - 2006/2 = 1003 \\times 2 - 2006/2 = 1003\\).\n\nNow, we need to find the maximum number of isosceles triangles that have two good sides. An isosceles triangle with two good sides must have its base as a good diagonal and its two equal sides as good sides. The key observation is that the base of such a triangle must be a good diagonal, and the two equal sides must be good sides. This means the base must be an odd number of sides long, and the two equal sides must be the sides of the polygon.\n\nTo maximize the number of such triangles, we need to ensure that the triangulation of the polygon uses as many good diagonals as possible. Each triangle in the triangulation can have at most one good diagonal as its base, and the two other sides must be good sides. The maximum number of such triangles is equal to the number of good diagonals, which is 1003.\n\nThus, the maximum number of isosceles triangles having two good sides that could appear in such a configuration is \\(\\boxed{1003}\\).", "answer": "1003"}

Let's denote the weights as \\( w_0 = 2^0, w_1 = 2^1, \\ldots, w_{n-1} = 2^{n-1} \\).\n\nWe can use a combinatorial approach to solve this problem. Consider the sequence of weights as a binary string of length \\( n \\), where each bit represents whether the corresponding weight is placed on the left pan (1) or the right pan (0). The condition that the right pan is never heavier than the left pan translates to the condition that the prefix sums of this binary string are non-negative.\n\nThis problem is equivalent to finding the number of valid sequences of \\( n \\) bits (each bit being 0 or 1) such that the partial sums of the sequence are non-negative.

The key insight is that we can use a line to separate one point from the rest. Specifically, we can use a line to separate one red point from all the blue points, then another line to separate one of the remaining red points from the rest, and so on.\n\nSince we have 2013 red points and 2014 blue points, we can use 2013 lines to separate each red point from the blue points.

A peaceful configuration means that each row and each column contains exactly one rook.\n\nFirst, consider the structure of the rooks' positions. Since each row and each column contains exactly one rook, the rooks form a permutation of the rows and columns. This means that if we label the rows and columns from 1 to \\( n \\), the rooks are placed at positions \\((i, \\sigma(i))\\) for \\( i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n \\), where \\(\\sigma\\) is a permutation of \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}\\).\n\nTo find the largest \\( k \\), we need to ensure that there is always a \\( k \\times k \\) square that does not contain any rook.

If we divide the \\( n \\times n \\) board into \\( \\left\\lceil \\frac{n}{k} \\right\\rceil \\times \\left\\lceil \\frac{n}{k} \\right\\rceil \\) smaller squares, then each of these smaller squares can contain at most one rook from each row and each column that intersects it.

If \\( k = \\left\\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rceil \\), then the number of rows and columns that can be covered by the rooks in any \\( k \\times k \\) square is at most \\( k \\). Since \\( k = \\left\\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rceil \\), the number of rows and columns that can be covered is at most \\( \\left\\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rceil \\), which means that in the worst case, there will be at least \\( n - \\left\\lceil \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rceil \\) rows and columns that are not covered by any rook in any \\( k \\times k \\) square.

This means that the resulting equation must be of the form \\((x - a_1)(x - a_2) \\cdots (x - a_m) = 0\\) where \\(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_m\\) are distinct and the equation has no real roots, which is impossible since any polynomial equation of degree \\(m\\) has at least one real root if \\(m > 0\\).
