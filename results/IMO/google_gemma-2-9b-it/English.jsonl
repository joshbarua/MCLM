Here's a breakdown of the key ideas:\n\n1. **Factorials and Prime Numbers:**  Factorials (like b!) are the product of all positive integers less than or equal to a given number.  A key property is that a prime number 'p' will divide a factorial if and only if 'p' is less than or equal to the number 'b'.\n\n2. **Modular Arithmetic:** We can use modular arithmetic to simplify our analysis.
