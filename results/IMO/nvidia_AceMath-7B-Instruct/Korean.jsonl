Let's start by understanding the structure and properties of the triangulation.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Triangulation\nA regular 2006-gon can be triangulated into 2004 triangles using 2003 diagonals. Each diagonal in the triangulation connects two non-adjacent vertices of the polygon. The key property we need to use is that each triangle in the triangulation has exactly one odd diagonal as a side, because the vertices of the polygon are alternately odd and even in terms of their indices.\n\n### Step 2: Counting the Odd Diagonals\nIn a regular 2006-gon, there are 2006 vertices, and each vertex is connected to 2003 other vertices by diagonals. However, each diagonal is counted twice (once from each endpoint), so the total number of diagonals is:\n\\[\n\\frac{2006 \\times 2003}{2} = 2006 \\times 1001 = 2008006\n\\]\nBut we are only interested in the odd diagonals. Since the vertices are alternately odd and even, each odd vertex is connected to 1003 other odd vertices by odd diagonals, and each even vertex is connected to 1003 other even vertices by odd diagonals. Again, each odd diagonal is counted twice, so the total number of odd diagonals is:\n\\[\n\\frac{2006 \\times 1003}{2} = 2006 \\times 501 = 1005003\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Counting the Isosceles Triangles with Two Odd Diagonals\nEach triangle in the triangulation has exactly one odd diagonal as a side. Therefore, the number of isosceles triangles with two odd diagonals is equal to the number of odd diagonals, which is 1005003.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nThe maximum number of isosceles triangles with two odd diagonals in the triangulation of a regular 2006-gon is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1003}\n\\]", "answer": "1003"}
