Find the maximum number of isosceles triangles having two good sides that could appear in such a configuration. ", "response": "To solve the problem, we start by understanding the properties of the regular 2006-gon \\( P \\) and the definition of a good diagonal. A diagonal is good if its endpoints divide the boundary of \\( P \\) into two parts, each composed of an odd number of sides of \\( P \\). The sides of \\( P \\) are also considered good.\n\nFirst, we note that a regular 2006-gon has 2006 vertices. When \\( P \\) is dissected into triangles by 2003 diagonals, we obtain 2004 triangles. We need to find the maximum number of isosceles triangles that have two good sides.\n\nA side of the 2006-gon is good, and a diagonal is good if it connects two vertices such that the number of sides between them on either side is odd. In a regular 2006-gon, a diagonal connecting vertices \\( i \\) and \\( j \\) is good if \\( |i - j| \\) or \\( 2006 - |i - j| \\) is odd. This means that \\( |i - j| \\) must be odd.\n\nNow, consider an isosceles triangle with two good sides. The two good sides must be either two sides of the 2006-gon or two diagonals. If the two good sides are two sides of the 2006-gon, the third side must be a diagonal connecting the endpoints of these two sides. Since the endpoints of a side are adjacent vertices, the distance between them is 1, which is odd. Therefore, the diagonal connecting them is good. This forms an isosceles triangle with two sides of the 2006-gon and one good diagonal.\n\nIf the two good sides are two diagonals, they must connect vertices such that the distances between the endpoints of each diagonal are odd. The third side of the isosceles triangle must be a side of the 2006-gon. However, the distance between the endpoints of this side must be even, which means it is not a good side. Therefore, this configuration does not form an isosceles triangle with two good sides.\n\nThus, the only isosceles triangles with two good sides are those with two sides of the 2006-gon and one good diagonal. Each side of the 2006-gon can be part of exactly one such isosceles triangle, because each side is part of exactly one triangle in the dissection. Since there are 2006 sides in the 2006-gon, there can be at most 2006 isosceles triangles with two good sides.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of isosceles triangles having two good sides that could appear in such a configuration is \\(\\boxed{1003}\\).", "answer": "1003"}

In such a coloring, no two adjacent cells (in the sense of the distance \\(\\sqrt{5}\\)) will have the same color. Without loss of generality, let's assume the top-left cell is black. Then, the black cells will form a pattern where no two black cells are at a distance of \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) from each other.\n\nIn a 20x20 grid, there are 200 black cells and 200 white cells. Amy can place a red stone on each black cell, ensuring that no two red stones are at a distance of \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) from each other. Therefore, the maximum number of red stones Amy can place is 200.\n\nTo confirm that this is the best possible, note that Ben's actions do not affect the number of red stones Amy can place, as long as Amy follows the strategy of placing red stones only on black cells. Ben can place blue stones on any remaining white cells, but this will not prevent Amy from placing a red stone on each black cell.\n\nThus, the greatest \\( K \\) such that Amy can ensure that she places at least \\( K \\) red stones is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{200}\n\\]", "answer": "100"}

Then \\(p\\) divides both \\(a_1^n + b_1\\) and \\(b_1^n + a_1\\). Therefore, \\(p\\) divides\n\n\\[\na_1^{2n} - b_1^{2n} = (a_1^n + b_1)(a_1^n - b_1).\n\\]\n\nSince \\(p\\) divides \\(a_1^n + b_1\\), it must divide \\(a_1^n - b_1\\). This implies that \\(p\\) divides \\(2b_1\\). Similarly, \\(p\\) divides \\(2a_1\\). Since \\(\\gcd(a_1, b_1) = 1\\), \\(p\\) must be 2. Therefore, the only possible prime divisor of \\(\\gcd(a_1^n + b_1, b_1^n + a_1)\\) is 2.\n\nWe now need to determine if \\(\\gcd(a_1^n + b_1, b_1^n + a_1)\\) is always 2 for sufficiently large \\(n\\). If \\(a_1\\) and \\(b_1\\) are both odd, then \\(a_1^n + b_1\\) and \\(b_1^n + a_1\\) are both even, so \\(\\gcd(a_1^n + b_1, b_1^n + a_1)\\) is at least 2. To show that it is exactly 2, we need to show that it is not divisible by any other prime. Since the only possible prime divisor is 2, \\(\\gcd(a_1^n + b_1, b_1^n + a_1) = 2\\).\n\nIf either \\(a_1\\) or \\(b_1\\) is even, then one of \\(a_1^n + b_1\\) or \\(b_1^n + a_1\\) is odd, so \\(\\gcd(a_1^n + b_1, b_1^n + a_1) = 1\\).\n\nTherefore, the pairs \\((a_1, b_1)\\) that satisfy the condition are those where \\(a_1\\) and \\(b_1\\) are both odd. Converting back to the original variables, the pairs \\((a, b)\\) are those where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both odd.\n\nThus, the final answer is\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(a, b) \\text{ where } a \\text{ and } b \\text{ are both odd}}.\n\\]", "answer": "(1, 1)"}
