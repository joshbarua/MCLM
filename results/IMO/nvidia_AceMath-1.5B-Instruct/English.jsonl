A diagonal of \\( P \\) is called good if its endpoints divide the boundary of \\( P \\) into two parts, each composed of an odd number of sides of \\( P \\). The sides of \\( P \\) are also considered good.\n\nFirst, we note that a regular 2006-gon has 2006 vertices. A diagonal is good if it connects two vertices such that the number of vertices between them (in either direction) is odd. This means that a good diagonal skips an even number of vertices.\n\nNext, we consider the dissection of \\( P \\) into triangles by 2003 diagonals, no two of which have a common point in the interior of \\( P \\). This dissection results in 2004 triangles. We need to find the maximum number of isosceles triangles that have two good sides.\n\nA key observation is that in a regular polygon, the sides and the diagonals that connect vertices skipping an even number of vertices (i.e., the good diagonals) form isosceles triangles with two good sides. Specifically, if we connect two vertices that are \\( k \\) vertices apart, where \\( k \\) is odd, the resulting triangle will have two good sides.\n\nTo maximize the number of such isosceles triangles, we need to consider the structure of the dissection. Each triangle in the dissection shares at most one side with another triangle. Therefore, the maximum number of isosceles triangles with two good sides is equal to the number of sides of \\( P \\) that are good, because each good side can be part of at most one such isosceles triangle.\n\nSince a regular 2006-gon has 2006 sides, and half of them are good (because the vertices are alternately good and not good), the number of good sides is 1003. Therefore, the maximum number of isosceles triangles with two good sides is 1003.\n\nThus, the maximum number of isosceles triangles having two good sides that could appear in such a configuration is \\(\\boxed{1003}\\).", "answer": "1003"}

Draw 2014 lines such that each line passes through one red point and one blue point, and no two lines are parallel or concurrent.
