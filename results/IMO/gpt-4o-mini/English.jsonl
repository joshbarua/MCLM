Since \\( P \\) has 2006 sides, the only way to split it into two odd parts is to have one part with \\( 1 \\) side and the other with \\( 2005 \\) sides. This means that a good diagonal connects a vertex to another vertex that is \\( 1 \\) side away from it, which is simply a side of the polygon.\n\nThus, all sides of \\( P \\) are good, and the good diagonals are those that connect vertices such that the number of sides between the two endpoints is odd.\n\n### Step 2: Counting Good Diagonals\nTo find the good diagonals, we note that if we label the vertices of \\( P \\) as \\( V_1, V_2, \\ldots, V_{2006} \\), a diagonal \\( V_i V_j \\) is good if the number of vertices between \\( V_i \\) and \\( V_j \\) (not including \\( V_i \\) and \\( V_j \\)) is odd. This occurs when \\( j - i \\) (mod 2006) is odd.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose two vertices \\( V_i \\) and \\( V_j \\) such that \\( j - i \\) is odd can be calculated as follows:\n- If \\( i \\) is odd, \\( j \\) must be even.\n- If \\( i \\) is even, \\( j \\) must be odd.\n\nSince there are 1003 odd vertices and 1003 even vertices, the number of good diagonals is:\n\\[\n1003 \\times 1003 = 1006009.\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Counting Isosceles Triangles with Good Sides\nNext, we need to find the maximum number of isosceles triangles that can be formed with two good sides. An isosceles triangle can be formed by selecting a vertex \\( V_i \\) and two other vertices \\( V_j \\) and \\( V_k \\) such that \\( V_j V_i \\) and \\( V_k V_i \\) are both good sides.\n\nFor \\( V_i \\) to form an isosceles triangle with \\( V_j \\) and \\( V_k \\):\n- \\( V_j \\) and \\( V_k \\) must be chosen such that both \\( V_j V_i \\) and \\( V_k V_i \\) are good sides.\n\n### Step 4: Configuration of Triangles\nTo maximize the number of isosceles triangles, we can consider the following:\n- Each vertex \\( V_i \\) can connect to \\( 1003 \\) good sides (since there are \\( 1003 \\) odd and \\( 1003 \\) even vertices).\n- For each vertex \\( V_i \\), we can choose any two good sides to form an isosceles triangle.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 good sides from 1003 good sides is given by:\n\\[\n\\binom{1003}{2} = \\frac{1003 \\times 1002}{2} = 502503.\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Total Count of Isosceles Triangles\nSince there are \\( 2006 \\) vertices in total, the total number of isosceles triangles with two good sides is:\n\\[\n2006 \\times 502503 = 1006001008.\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThus, the maximum number of isosceles triangles having two good sides that could appear in such a configuration is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1006001008}.\n\\]", "answer": "1003"}

Thus, the remaining \\( k - n \\) toggles must be used to toggle these lamps off, and they can be toggled any number of times as long as they end up off.\n\nThe number of ways to choose \\( n \\) toggles for the first \\( n \\) lamps is still:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{k}{n}\n\\]\n\nHowever, since we are not toggling the last \\( n \\) lamps on, we do not have any additional choices for the remaining \\( k - n \\) steps.

This implies that the rooks occupy \\( n \\) distinct squares on the board.\n\nTo analyze the problem, we can consider the placement of the rooks. Since there are \\( n \\) rooks, they occupy \\( n \\) different rows and \\( n \\) different columns. We can denote the position of the rook in row \\( i \\) as being in column \\( c_i \\), where \\( c_i \\) is a permutation of the set \\( \\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\} \\).\n\nNow, we want to find the largest \\( k \\) such that there exists a \\( k \\times k \\) square that does not contain any rooks. \n\n### Step 1: Understanding the placement of rooks\n\nIn any peaceful configuration, the rooks occupy \\( n \\) distinct columns and rows. Therefore, if we consider any \\( k \\times k \\) square on the chessboard, it can be positioned in various ways depending on the indices of its top-left corner.\n\n### Step 2: Counting the available squares\n\nThe total number of \\( k \\times k \\) squares that can be placed on an \\( n \\times n \\) chessboard is given by the number of ways to choose the top-left corner of the square. The top-left corner can be placed in any of the positions \\( (i, j) \\) where \\( 1 \\leq i \\leq n-k+1 \\) and \\( 1 \\leq j \\leq n-k+1 \\). Thus, the total number of \\( k \\times k \\) squares is \\( (n-k+1)^2 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Finding the maximum \\( k \\)\n\nTo ensure that at least one \\( k \\times k \\) square is free of rooks, we can use the pigeonhole principle. If we have \\( n \\) rooks and we want to ensure that there is at least one \\( k \\times k \\) square that does not contain any rooks, we need to consider how many rooks can potentially occupy the squares in any \\( k \\times k \\) area.\n\nIf we place \\( k \\) rooks in each row and each column of a \\( k \\times k \\) square, we can cover \\( k^2 \\) squares with \\( k \\) rooks. Therefore, if \\( k \\) is too large, it may be possible for all \\( k \\times k \\) squares to contain at least one rook.\n\n### Step 4: Applying the pigeonhole principle\n\nIf we set \\( k = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor \\), we can analyze the situation. In this case, we can have \\( n \\) rooks occupying \\( n \\) rows and \\( n \\) columns, and we can fit \\( k \\) rooks in a \\( k \\times k \\) square. \n\nIf \\( k = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor \\), then the number of \\( k \\times k \\) squares is \\( (n-k+1)^2 \\). The maximum number of rooks that can be placed in any \\( k \\times k \\) square is \\( k^2 \\). \n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, the largest \\( k \\) such that there is guaranteed to be at least one \\( k \\times k \\) square without any rooks is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor}\n\\]", "answer": "\\lfloor \\sqrt{n - 1} \\rfloor"}

Therefore, we can simplify our task to finding a way to erase factors such that the resulting equation has no real solutions.\n\nThe left-hand side and right-hand side both consist of the same polynomial, which is a degree 2016 polynomial. The roots of this polynomial are \\(x = 1, 2, \\ldots, 2016\\). \n\nTo ensure that the resulting equation has no real solutions, we need to manipulate the equation such that the polynomial on one side has no common roots with the polynomial on the other side.

This occurs when the discriminant is zero:\n\n\\[\n4x^2 - 4c^2 x^2 = 0 \\implies 1 - c^2 = 0 \\implies c = 1.\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, we find that \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x} \\) is a candidate. We can verify:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = \\frac{1}{x} \\implies f(y) = \\frac{1}{y}.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting back into the original inequality:\n\n\\[\nx \\cdot \\frac{1}{y} + y \\cdot \\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{x}{y} + \\frac{y}{x} = \\frac{x^2 + y^2}{xy} \\leq 2.\n\\]\n\nThis holds true if \\( x = y \\), confirming that \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x} \\) satisfies the condition.\n\nThus, the only function \\( f : \\mathbb{R}^+ \\to \\mathbb{R}^+ \\) that satisfies the given condition is \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{f(x) = \\frac{1}{x}}.\n\\]", "answer": "\\frac{1}{x}"}

This means that for a cell to be a valley, all of its adjacent cells must contain numbers greater than the number in the valley cell.\n\n2. **Uphill Paths**: An uphill path starts from a valley and moves to adjacent cells with increasing numbers. The goal is to minimize the total number of such paths.\n\n### Strategy for Minimizing Uphill Paths\n\nTo minimize the number of uphill paths, we can maximize the number of valleys. If we can ensure that many cells are valleys, we can potentially reduce the number of uphill paths that can be formed.\n\n#### Construction of the Nordic Square\n\nOne effective way to construct the Nordic square is to arrange the numbers in a specific pattern. A common approach is to fill the square in a \"snake-like\" or \"zigzag\" manner. For example, for \\( n = 3 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n6 & 5 & 4 \\\\\n7 & 8 & 9\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nIn this arrangement:\n- The valleys are the cells containing 1, 4, and 6. \n- Each of these valleys is surrounded by larger numbers.\n\n#### Counting Valleys\n\nIn a \\( n \\times n \\) grid, we can analyze the placement of valleys:\n- The corners of the grid can be valleys if they are the smallest numbers in their respective rows and columns.\n- The edge cells (not corners) can also be valleys if they are smaller than their adjacent cells.\n\nFor a general \\( n \\times n \\) grid, we can place valleys in a way that maximizes their count. A simple arrangement is to place the smallest numbers in a pattern that ensures they are surrounded by larger numbers.\n\n### Calculation of Uphill Paths\n\n1. **Valleys Count**: In a \\( n \\times n \\) grid, we can ensure that at least \\( n \\) valleys exist by placing the smallest numbers in a way that they are surrounded by larger numbers.\n\n2. **Uphill Paths from Valleys**: Each valley can potentially lead to multiple uphill paths depending on the arrangement of the numbers. However, if we ensure that each valley only connects to one larger number, we can minimize the paths.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter analyzing the arrangement and counting the valleys, we find that the minimum number of uphill paths can be achieved by ensuring that each valley connects to only one larger number. \n\nThus, the smallest possible total number of uphill paths in a Nordic square of size \\( n \\times n \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{n}\n\\] \n\nThis is because we can arrange the numbers such that each valley leads to exactly one uphill path, resulting in \\( n \\) paths in total.", "answer": "2n^2-2n+1"}
