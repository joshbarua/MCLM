It means that the rule must be consistent and follow a strict ordering.\n\nGiven these conditions, the only rule that satisfies all of them is the rule based on the order of the cards. Specifically, \\(A\\) beats \\(B\\) if and only if the \\(i\\)-th smallest card in \\(A\\) is greater than the \\(i\\)-th smallest card in \\(B\\) for all \\(i\\). This is known as the lexicographic order or the majorization order.\n\nSince the rule is uniquely determined by the order of the cards and there is only one way to define such a rule, the number of ways to define such a rule is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\] \n\nThis is because the rule is completely specified by the conditions given and there is only one possible rule that satisfies all of them. The transitivity and the condition on the relative order of the cards are enough to uniquely define the rule. Thus, there is only one way to define the rule that satisfies all the given conditions.
