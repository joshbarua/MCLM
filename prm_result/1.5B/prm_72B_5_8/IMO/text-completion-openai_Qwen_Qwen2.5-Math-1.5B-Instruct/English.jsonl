Since 2006 is even, a diagonal is good if it connects two vertices such that the number of sides in each of the two parts is odd. This means the vertices must be an odd number of vertices apart.\n\nWhen \\(P\\) is dissected into triangles by 2003 diagonals, we have 2004 triangles in total (since each diagonal added to the dissection increases the number of triangles by 1,  starting from 1 triangle with no diagonals).\n\nNext, we need to consider the properties of isosceles triangles with two good sides. In a regular polygon, an isosceles triangle with two good sides must have its vertex at a vertex of the polygon and its base as a good diagonal. This is because the two equal sides of the isosceles triangle must be sides of the polygon, and the base must be a good diagonal.\n\nSince each vertex of the polygon can be the vertex of at most one such isosceles triangle (because each vertex is connected to at most one other vertex by a good diagonal that forms an isosceles triangle with the vertex itself as the apex), and there are 2006 vertices, the maximum number of such isosceles triangles is 1003 (since each triangle uses up two vertices, and we have 2006 vertices).\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of isosceles triangles having two good sides that could appear in such a configuration is \\(\\boxed{1003}\\).```\n```The final answer is \\(\\boxed{1003}\\).``````\n```The final answer is \\(\\boxed{1003}\\", "answer": "1003"}

The first equation tells us that the sum of fractions with powers of 2 in the denominator equals 1. Since each term is a fraction less than or equal to 1, we need to find a way to sum these fractions to 1. The simplest way to do this is to use the binary representation of 1, which is \\( 1 = \\frac{1}{2^0} + \\frac{1}{2^1} + \\frac{1}{2^2} + \\cdots \\).

A good arrangement means that no line passes through any point, and no region contains points of both colors.\n\nWe start by considering the properties of the points and the lines. Since no three points are collinear, we can use the concept of separating lines to separate the points by color. The key insight is that we need to separate the red points from the blue points using lines.\n\nFirst, we note that if we have a single line that separates the plane into two regions, it is possible that one region contains only red points and the other contains only blue points, or vice versa. However, if we use multiple lines, we can potentially create more regions and separating the points more effectively.\n\nThe problem can be approached using the concept of a separating line arrangement. A well-known result in combinatorial geometry states that for any set of \\( n \\) points in the plane, there exists a line that can separate the plane into two regions such that each region contains at most \\( \\left\\lceil \\frac{n}{2}  \\right\\rceil \\) points of one color and at most \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor \\) points of the other color.

We can then repeat this process for the region with 1007 red points and 1007 blue points, and so on, until all points are separated.\n\nTo determine the minimum number of lines required, we can use the fact that each line can separate the plane into two regions, and we need to separate the points iteratively. The number of lines required is essentially the number of times we need to divide the points until they are all separated. For 2013 red points and 2014 blue points, we need to draw lines that separate the points in such a way that no region  contains points of both colors. The number of lines required is the number of times we can divide the points until they are all separated, which is equivalent to the number of times we need to apply the separating line algorithm.\n\nThe number of lines required is given by the formula for the number of regions created by \\( k \\) lines, which is \\( \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} + 1 \\).

Therefore, the least value of \\( k \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2013}\n\\] \n\nThis is because each line can separate the plane into two regions, and we need to separate the points iteratively until they are all separated, which requires 2013 lines.

Let's start by considering the case when \\( k = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor \\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Consider \\( k = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor \\):**\n   - For \\( n = 2m \\) (even), \\( k = m \\). So, we need to check if there is always an \\( m \\times m \\) square  that is rook-free.\n   - For \\( n = 2m + 1 \\) (odd), \\( k = m \\). So, we need to check if there is always an \\( m \\times m \\) square that is rook-free.\n\n2. **Example with \\( n = 4 \\):**\n   - A small example is a \\( 4 \\times 4 \\) board. A possible peaceful configuration could be:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\n     \\hline\n     R &   &   &   \\\\\n     \\hline\n       & R &   &   \\\\\n     \\hline\n       &   & R &   \\\\\n     \\hline\n       &   &   & R \\\\\n     \\hline\n     \\end{array}\n     \\]\n   - Here, the \\( 2 \\times 2 \\) square in the top-left corner is rook-free. So, \\( k = 2 \\) works for \\( n = 4 \\).\n\n3. **General Case:**\n   - For \\( n = 2m \\), consider the worst-case scenario where rooks are placed in such a way that they cover the  largest possible squares. If we place rooks in a diagonal pattern, the largest rook-free square will be of size \\( m-1 \\times m-1 \\). However, since we are looking for the largest \\( k \\) that always works, we need to ensure that \\( k \\) is large enough to cover all possible configurations.\n   - For \\( n = 2m + 1 \\), the same logic applies, and we can always find a rook-free square of size \\( m \\times m \\).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The largest \\( k \\) that always works for any \\( n \\) is \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor \\).\n\nThus, the greatest positive integer \\( k \\) such that, for each peaceful configuration of \\( n \\) rooks, there is a \\( k \\times k \\) square which does not contain a rook on any of its \\( k^2 \\) unit squares is \\(\\boxed{\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor}\\).```\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor}\\).", "answer": "\\lfloor \\sqrt{n - 1} \\rfloor"}

In this case, we have:\n\\[\na^n + b = a^n + a = a(a^{n-1} + 1) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad b^n + a = a^n + a = a(a^{n-1} + 1).\n\\]\nClearly, \\(\\gcd(a(a^{n-1} + 1), a(a^{n-1} + 1)) = a\\). Since \\(a\\) is a positive integer, we can choose \\(g = a\\) and \\(N = 1\\), and the condition \\(\\gcd(a^n + a, a^n + a) = a\\) holds for all \\(n > 1\\). Therefore, any pair \\((a, a)\\) is a solution.\n\nNow, we consider the case when \\(a \\neq b\\). In this case, we need to analyze the divisibility properties of \\(a^{n+1} - b^{n+1}\\). Notice that \\(a^{n+1} - b^{n+1}\\) is divisible by \\(a - b\\) for all \\(n\\). This is because \\(a^{n+1} - b^{n+1} = (a  - b)(a^n + a^{n-1}b + \\cdots + ab^n + b^n)\\). Therefore, \\(d\\) must divide \\(a - b\\).\n\nSince \\(d\\) divides both \\(a^n + b\\) and \\(b^n + a\\) for all \\(n > N\\), it must also divide their difference \\(a^n + b - (b^n + a) = a^n - b^n\\). This implies that \\(d\\) divides \\(a - b\\) for all \\(n > N\\). However, since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are fixed, the only way \\(d\\) can divide \\(a - b\\) for all \\(n > N\\) is if \\(d\\) is a divisor of \\(a - b\\). But since \\(d\\) must also divide \\(a^n + b\\) and \\(b^n + a\\) for all \\(n > N\\), and since \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are fixed, the only way this can happen is if \\(d = 1\\).\n\nThus, the only way for the condition \\(\\gcd(a^n + b, b^n + a) = g\\) to hold for all \\(n > N\\) is if \\(a = b\\).  Therefore, the only solutions are of the form \\((a, a)\\) for any positive integer \\(a\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{(a, a)}\n\\] for any positive integer \\(a\\). \\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\\end{document}$$\n```markdown\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{(a, a)}\\) for any positive integer \\(a\\). \\(\\blacksquare\\)\n``` Floor\n```markdown\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{(a, a)}\\) for any positive integer \\(a\\). \\(\\blacksquare\\)\n```floor\n```markdown\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{(a, a)}\\) for any positive integer \\(a\\). \\(\\blacksquare\\)\n```floor\n```markdown\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{(a, a)}\\) for any positive integer \\(a\\). \\(\\blacksquare\\)\n```floor\n```markdown\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{(a, a)}\\) for any positive integer \\(a\\). \\(\\blacksquare\\)\n```floor\n```markdown\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{(a, a)}\\) for any positive integer \\(a\\).", "answer": "(1, 1)"}
